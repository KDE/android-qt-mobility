<a name="overview"></a>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>These APIs give the developer a wide range of desirable functions for a mobile platform. A mobile device using the Qt Mobility API should be able to</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate services on-board or remotely. Find an optimal connection to the network for the particular service.</li>
<li>Services built on top of this would include Internet applications such as email and web browsing.</li>
<li>Multimedia features enable image and video capture with audio , audio recording, and the playing of music or video clips.</li>
<li>Location will make the device aware of its geographical location to support GIS applications.</li>
<li>Publish-Subscribe enables a flexible behavior for changed circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<a name="bearer-management"></a>
<h3>Bearer Management</h3>
<p>Although not a network manager, this component manages the connectivity state to the network. So it does not manage network configurations, which are the role of the platform provider, but it does allow the user to start or stop network interfaces. Some higher level management of the connection session may also be possible as well depending on the platform.</p>
<p>Some platforms can have a set of grouped access points perhaps based on a common purpose. Bearer Management allows comparison and prioritization of the access and use of these points.</p>
<p>The aim of Bearer Management is to reduce the need for the developer to be concerned about trying to locate the best connection from a list of possible IP bearers and 3G connections. The user can select the best or it can be selected transparently so that WLAN roaming can occur seemlessly.</p>
<p>Some examples of the Bearer Management functionality,</p>
<ul>
<li>On demand use of the appropriate Access Point. When a user starts to use a browser, the appropriate access point is selected from those available and a connection is transparently made.</li>
<li>Always-on applications such as email or IM roam automatically between cellular packet data and WLAN networks. The application developer is in control and for example the application can gracefully close TCP connections over the old bearer after setting up new TCP connections over the new bearer.</li>
<li>Application developer can create a settings user interface, where the user can select a certain connection to be used with the application</li>
<li>A connection manager application can be implemented with Qt. This application enumerates available connections, shows counters, and allows the user to connect or disconnect</li>
</ul>
<a name="contacts"></a>
<h3>Contacts</h3>
<p>The structure and retrieval of contact data from local or remote backends. It includes the ability to create, edit, list, delete and lookup contact information whether it is stored locally or remotely.</p>
<a name="publish-and-subscribe"></a>
<h3>Publish and Subscribe</h3>
<p>Enables context sensitive access to information. Data is organized as a tree, with data being able to 'shadow' other data with the 'same key', a string specifying the leaf or node. The context is an example of a context ontology, a defined set of relationships. As the context changes the values of the objects change but the relationships remain the same. It is intended to be an enabling technology, the basis of a range future applications.</p>
<p>For example, this will make personalization easier as different people would represent a different context. Or behavior of the device that changes depending on physical location or device status.</p>
<a name="location"></a>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>The C++ API is one layer of this feature. This API encapsulates basic geographical information obtained from satellite or other sources about the user, including latitude and longitude, bearing, speed and altitude. It will enable a range of geographical applications, for example, maps.</p>
<a name="messaging"></a>
<h3>Messaging</h3>
<p>A common interface for handling SMS, MMS, XMPP, Email and partial MIME. Sending, notification and retrieval of messages as well as the ability to use a native app to create, edit, reply-to, send and display messages. Supports the sending of messages with attachments, and in situations of low battery to leave attachments on the server unless opened.</p>
<a name="multimedia"></a>
<h3>Multimedia</h3>
<p>An API to record and play audio and video of various formats. The playing and managing of a FM radio. This includes the typical functionality you would find on a music player, combined with FM radio, and camera for still and video recording.</p>
<a name="service-framework"></a>
<h3>Service Framework</h3>
<p>A platform independent method of finding Services. A 'service' is an independent component that allows a client to perform a well-defined operation.</p>
<p>The services are implemented as plugins installed on the device and can look for supporting external services running on a central server. E.g&#x2e; weather, local tourist attractions etc. Also default applications can use the layer to locate servers. Since this is a level of abstraction then the app does not need to be concerned with the underlying protocol, where the servers are, the hardware peculiarities with networking and other low level details.</p>

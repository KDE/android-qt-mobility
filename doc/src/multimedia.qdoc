\title Multimedia
\brief Provides a set of APIs to play and record media, and manage a 
collection of media content.
\ingroup mobility

Multimedia provides a set of APIs that allow the developer to play, record
and manage a collection of media content. It is dependent on the
QtMultimediaKit module. This API is planned to replace Phonon at a later stage.

\tableofcontents

\section1 No Special Namespace

Unlike the other APIs in Qt Mobility, the Multimedia API is \i not in the
\i QtMobility namespace.

\section1 Overview

This library will require Qt 4.6.

This API delivers an easy to use interface to multimedia functions. The 
developer can use the API to display an image, or a video, record sound or play a
multimedia stream.

There are several benefits this API brings to Qt. Firstly, the
developer can now implement fundamental multimedia functions with minimal
code, mostly because they are already implemented. Also there is a great
deal of flexibility with the media source or the generated multimedia. The
source file does not need to be local to the device, it could be streamed from a remote location and identified by a URL. Finally, many different codecs are supported 'out
of the box'.

The supplied examples give a good idea at the ease of use of the API. When
the supporting user interface code is ignored we can see that functionality
is immediately available with minimal effort.

\section2 Audio

The Audio Recorder example is a good introduction to the basic use of the API. We will use snippets from this example to illustrate how to use the
API to quickly build functionality.

The first step is to demonstrate recording audio to a file. When recording from an audio source there are a number of things we may want to control beyond the essential user interface. We may want a particular encoding of the file, MP3 or Ogg Vorbis for instance, or select a different input source. The user may modify the bitrate, number of channels, quality and sample rate. Here the example will only modify the codec and the source device, since they are essential.

To begin, the developer sets up a source and a recorder object. A
\l{QAudioCaptureSource} object is created and used to initialize a \l{QMediaRecorder} object. The output file name is then set for the \l{QMediaRecorder} object.

\code
    audiosource = new QAudioCaptureSource;
    capture = new QMediaRecorder(audiosource);

    capture->setOutputLocation(QUrl("test.raw"));
\endcode

A list of devices is needed so that an input can be selected in the user interface

\code
    for(int i = 0; i < audiosource->deviceCount(); i++)
        deviceBox->addItem(audiosource->name(i));
\endcode

and a list of the supported codecs for the user to select a codec,

\code
    QStringList codecs = capture->supportedAudioCodecs();
    for(int i = 0; i < codecs.count(); i++)
        codecsBox->addItem(codecs.at(i));
\endcode

To set the selected device or codec just use the index of the device or codec by calling the setter in \i {audiosource} or \i {capture} as appropriate, for example,

\code
    audiosource->setSelectedDevice(i);
    ...
    capture->setAudioCodec(codecIdx);
\endcode

Now start recording by using the \l {QMediaRecorder}{record()} function from the new \l{QMediaRecorder} object

\code
    capture->record();
\endcode

And stop recording by calling the matching function \l {QMediaRecorder::stop()}{stop()} in \l{QMediaRecorder}.

\code
    capture->stop();
\endcode

How then would this audio file be played? The \l {QMediaPlayer} class will be
used as a generic player. Since the player can play both video and audio files the interface will be more complex, but for now the example will concentrate on the audio aspect.

Playing the file is simple: create a player object, pass in the filename, set
the volume or other parameters, then play. Not forgetting that the code will
need to be hooked up to the user interface.

\code
    QMediaPlayer *player = new QMediaPlayer;
    ...
    player->setMedia(QUrl::fromLocalFile("test.raw"));
    player->setVolume(50);
    player->play();
\endcode

The filename does not have to be a local file. It could be a URL to a
remote resource. Also by using the \l{QMediaPlaylist} class from this API
we can play a list of local or remote files. The \l{QMediaPlaylist}
class supports constructing, managing and playing playlists.

\code
    player = new QMediaPlayer;

    playlist = new QMediaPlaylist(player);
    playlist->append(QUrl("http://example.com/myfile1.mp3"));
    playlist->append(QUrl("http://example.com/myfile2.mp3"));
    ...
    playlist->setCurrentPosition(1);
    player->play();
\endcode

To manipulate the playlist there are the usual management functions (which are in fact slots): previous, next, setCurrentPosition and shuffle. Playlists can be built, saved and loaded using the API.



\section2 Video

Continuing with the example discussed for an Audio recorder/player, we can use this to show how to play video files with little change to the code.

Moving from audio to video requires few changes in the sample code. To play a
video playlist the code can be changed to include another new Mobility
Project class: \l{QVideoWidget}. This class enables control of a video
resource with signals and slots for the control of brightness, contrast,
hue, saturation and full screen mode.

\code
    player = new QMediaPlayer;

    playlist = new QMediaPlaylist(player);
    playlist->append(QUrl("http://example.com/myclip1.mp4"));
    playlist->append(QUrl("http://example.com/myclip2.mp4"));
    ...
    widget = new QVideoWidget(player);
    widget->show();

    playlist->setCurrentPosition(1);
    player->play();
\endcode

The \l {player}{Player} example does things a bit differently to our sample code. instead of using a QVideoWidget object directly, the Player example has a \i {VideoWidget} class that inherits from QVideoWidget. This means that functions can be added to provide functions such as full screen display, either on a double click or on a particular keypress.

\snippet ../../examples/player/player.cpp  2


\section2 Radio

QRadioTunerControl is a pure virtual base class that will be the basis for
any platform specific radio device control. When the functions are
implemented the developer will be able to quickly produce an application
that supports the typical uses of an FM radio including tuning, volume,
start, stop and various other controls.

\section1 Extending the API for Symbian and Maemo


For the developer who wishes to extend the functionality of the Multimedia
classes there are several classes of particular importance. The default
classes are QMediaService, QMediaServiceProvider and QMediaControl.

Basically, the idea is that to use the Multimedia API you would use these three classes or classes derived from them as follows

    \list
    \o \l QMediaServiceProvider is used by the top level client class to request a service. The top level class knowing what kind of service it needs.

    \o \l QMediaService provides a service and when asked by the top level object, say a component, will return a QMediaControl object.

    \o \l QMediaControl allows the control of the service using a known interface.
    \endlist

Consider a developer creating, for example, a media player class called MyPlayer. It may have special requirements beyond ordinary media players and so may need a custom service and a custom control. We can subclass \l QMediaServiceProvider to create out MyServiceProvider class. Also we will create a MyMediaService, and the MyMediaControl to manipulate the media service.

The MyPlayer object calls MyServiceProvider::requestService() to get an instance of MyMediaService. Then the MyPlayer object calls this service object it has just received and calling \l {QMediaService::control()}{control()} it will receive the control object derived from QMediaControl. Now we have all the parts necessary for our media application. We have the service provider, the service it provides and the control used to manipulate the service. Since our MyPlayer object has instances of the service and its control then it would be possible for these to be used by associated classes that could do additional actions, perhaps with their own control since the parameter to control() is a c-type string, \i {const char *}, for the interface.


\section2 Adding a Media Service Provider

The base class for creating new service providers is \l{QMediaServiceProvider}. The user must implement the \l{QMediaServiceProvider::requestService()}{requestService()} function

\code
    QMediaService* requestService(const QByteArray &type, const QMediaServiceProviderHint &hint);
\endcode

The details of implementation will depend on the provider. Looking at the class \l QMediaServiceProvider for the default implementation. Notice that \l {QMediaServiceProvider::requestService()}{requestService()} uses the \l QMediaServiceProviderHint to look for the appropriate plugin and then to insert it into the plugin map. However, for a specific service provider there is probably no need for this approach, it will simply depend on what the developer wants to implement.

Other methods that may be overloaded
\code
    void releaseService(QMediaService *service);

    QtMediaServices::SupportEstimate hasSupport(const QByteArray &serviceType,
                                        const QString &mimeType,
                                        const QStringList& codecs,
                                        int flags) const;

    QStringList supportedMimeTypes(const QByteArray &serviceType, int flags) const;

    QList<QByteArray> devices(const QByteArray &serviceType) const;

    QString deviceDescription(const QByteArray &serviceType, const QByteArray &device);
\endcode

The choice of what needs to be done depends on what the developer wishes to do with the service.


\section1 Examples

\section2 Record a Sound Source

\l{audiorecorder}{AudioRecorder} is a demonstration of the discovery of
the supported devices and codecs and the use of recording functions in the
QMediaRecorder class.

\section2 Play a Media File

The \l{player}{Player} example is a simple multimedia player. Select a
video file to play, stop, pause, show in fullscreen or manipulate various
image attributes using the Color Options button.

\section2 Slide Show

The \l{slideshow}{Slide Show} shows the use of the QMediaImageViewer and
QVideoWidget classes.

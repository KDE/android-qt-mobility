    \section1 Platform Issues
    \section2 Symbian

    The program 'qmlviewer' has certain default capabilities. When a developer
    writes a QML script that uses some special capabilities, for example Location,
    it may seem natural that moving this working script to a Symbian platform
    should be uneventful. However, the version of 'qmlviewer' may not know
    about this capability. If that is the case then 'qmlviewer' should be
    recompiled by the developer with the capability explicitly added.

    It should be noted that the use of a plugin, with capabilities outside
    of "NetworkServices ReadUserData", and viewed on a Symbian device via
    qmlviewer.exe will either fail to work or cause qmlviewer to be terminated.

    In the above example, qmlviewer needs to be recompiled with
    \code
    TARGET.CAPABILITY = NetworkServices ReadUserData Location
    \endcode
    and installed.

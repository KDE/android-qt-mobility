    \title System Information Example


    \image sysinfo.png
    

    The System Information example uses a tabbed dialog, with each tab
    representing a particular type of data: versions, network and so on.

    To access the information, the example creates objects belonging to the System Information classes

    \annotatedlist systeminfo

    Here are some examples that show how the example application reads the
    device information.

    The current language

    \snippet ../../examples/sysinfo/dialog.cpp  lang

    Device information, starting with the battery level

    \snippet ../../examples/sysinfo/dialog.cpp  createdi
    \dots
    \snippet ../../examples/sysinfo/dialog.cpp  batteryLevel

    The manufacturer id and the product name
    
    \snippet ../../examples/sysinfo/dialog.cpp  manuf-id
    \dots
    \snippet ../../examples/sysinfo/dialog.cpp  productName

    And there are signals that can be used to update progress bars and other
    indicators. An example is when the battery level changes, the batteryLevelChanged() signal is emitted

    \snippet ../../examples/sysinfo/dialog.cpp  sig batteryLevelChanged


    Other information is stored as bitwise flags. The following code shows
    the input methods being determined using flags.

    \snippet ../../examples/sysinfo/dialog.cpp  inputMethod flags

    Various capabilities of the device can be found by testing for features.
    In the example a Feature combo box, on the General tab, has a hard coded
    list of features. When a listed feature is selected the getFeature()
    function is called with the index which is handled by applying a test to
    the corresponding feature.

    \snippet ../../examples/sysinfo/dialog.cpp  feature
    \dots
    \snippet ../../examples/sysinfo/dialog.cpp  feature-bluetooth
    \dots
    \snippet ../../examples/sysinfo/dialog.cpp  feature test

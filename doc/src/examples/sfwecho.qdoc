    \title Echo Client Example

    This example demonstrates the Qt Service Framework inter-process mechanism
    that allows services to be deployed as remote services. Multiple clients
    can be run to communicate with one another using a shared instance of the
    echo service, or privately with a unique instance.

    The second echo client is for running a second identical instance on Symbian
    which usually does not allow starting the same program multiple times.

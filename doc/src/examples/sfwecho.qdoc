    \title Echo Client Example

    This example demonstrates the Qt Service Framework inter-process mechanism
    that allows services to be deployed as remote services. Multiple clients
    can be run to communicate with one another using a shared instance of the
    echo service, or privately with a unique instance.

    The second echo client is for running a second identical instance on Symbian
    which usually does not allow starting the same program multiple times.

    For Maemo and Linux platforms using D-Bus as the underlying IPC mechanism,
    the autostart feature can be intialised by running the service framework tool
    in the the mobility binary install folder:

    \code
        servicefw dbusservice xmldata/sfwechoservice.xml sfwecho_service
    \endcode

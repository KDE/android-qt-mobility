    \title Accessing Publish and Subscribe from QML

    This examples shows how to access published context values from within QML.  The example
    consists of two programs.  The first, battery-provider, is a standard Qt GUI application that
    is used to emulate a battery for the sole purpose of demonstrating the second program.  It
    publishes the keys

    \code
        /power/battery/charge
        /power/battery/charging
    \endcode

    and provides controls for modifying their values.

    The second program, battery-consumer, is implemented in QML with some C++ code to display the
    QML and make QValueSpaceSubscriber available from within QML.

    The user interface of the battery consumer program is described in QML.  It has the following
    features: A rectangular area representing the percent charge of the battery.  It indicates a
    low battery state by changing the color to red, it is green otherwise.  An animation is shown
    to indicate that the battery is being recharged.

    \section2 Battery Consumer

    The first step is to make QValueSpaceSubscriber available from within QML so that our QML code
    can access the keys published by the battery-provider.  This is achieved by using the
    QML_DECLARE_TYPE() and QML_DEFINE_TYPE() macros.  The following code makes
    QValueSpaceSubscriber available from within QML as ValueSpaceSubscriber.

    \section3 QML

    Two ValueSpaceSubscriber instances are created, one for each of the battery values.  We give
    each object a unique id so that we can reference it from elsewhere in the QML.  We set the
    \i path properties to the Value Space path of the keys.  Finally we set the \i notify
    properties to true to enable the emission of change notification signals.

    The default state of the rectangle used to visualize the battery charge uses the \i charge
    property of our BatteryCharge class in the expression for its height.

    \snippet battery-charge/battery-consumer/battery-meter.qml 1

    When the battery charge changes the height of the rectangle will automatically change.

    Next we define two additional states.  The \i low state is entered when the battery charge
    drops below 25% and the battery is not being recharged.  When in this state the color is set to
    red.

    \snippet battery-charge/battery-consumer/battery-meter.qml 2

    The \i charging state is entered when the battery is being recharged.  When in this state a
    particle effect animation is enabled.

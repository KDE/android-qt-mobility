    \title Query Messages Example



    This simple example shows how to query messages stored in the system, 
    using the Qt Mobility Messaging API. 

    Messages are queried by using the QMessageStore interface which 
    provides access to the message data stored in the system.  We will
    use the \l{QMessageStore::queryMessages()}{queryMessages} function to 
    locate messages that match a filter object which defines the 
    properties of the messages we would like to find.  
    
    We define our query properties like this:

    \snippet    ../../examples/querymessages/main.cpp setup-query

    Then we use these properties to extract the set of matching message
    identifiers from the QMessageStore instance:

    \snippet    ../../examples/querymessages/main.cpp perform-query

    Now we can iterate over our list of message identifiers, retrieving
    a QMessage instance containing the details of each message in turn:

    \snippet    ../../examples/querymessages/main.cpp iterate-results

    For each message we located, we now generate an output element 
    corresponding to each data item requested at the command line:

    \snippet    ../../examples/querymessages/main.cpp generate-output

    Finally, we print the results accumulated for each message that
    matched our query.

    \snippet    ../../examples/querymessages/main.cpp print-result

    \title SlideShow Example


    \image slideshow-img1.png


    Slideshow displays a series of time delayed images after you select a
    source image directory to use. The folder button presents a list of three
    options: browse for a directory, load a playlist or enter a location.

    This implementation uses a QMediaImageViewer object for the image with
    a QVideoWidget used to do the display. Whether the the source is a
    browsed directory, a playlist file or a URL to a local or remote
    location the playlist object in Slideshow is updated with the file or
    multiple file locations. 

    \code
        connect(imageViewer, SIGNAL(stateChanged(QMediaImageViewer::State)),
                this, SLOT(stateChanged(QMediaImageViewer::State)));

        playlist = new QMediaPlaylist(imageViewer);
    \endcode

    We create a QVideoWidget to display the viewer and add it to the dialog.

    \code
        QVideoWidget *videoWidget = new QVideoWidget(imageViewer);
    \endcode


    \code
        layout->addWidget(videoWidget, Qt::AlignCenter);
    \endcode


    The timeout between images is set by changing the timeout property in
    QMediaImageViewer which is in milliseconds. So to change the timeout
    to five seconds
    \code
        imageViewer->setTimeout( 5000 );
    \endcode

    \title Music Browser

    This example demonstrates using the Document Gallery QML elements to
    navigate a music collection.

    The main menu of the music browser contains links to the four sub-menus
    each of which displays a different type of gallery item. The \l GalleryType
    element provides the number of items in each sub-menu.

    Each sub-menu contains a list of items populated using the
    \l GalleryQueryModel element.  Selecting an item from one of the the Albums,
    Artists, or Genres menus will display a list of songs which belong to the
    selected item.

    Selecting a song from the music browser will display a dialog with
    information about a song provided by the \l GalleryItem element. Property
    values changed in this dialog are written back to the \l GalleryItem
    element and saved to the gallery.

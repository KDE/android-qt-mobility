    \title Notes Manager Plugin Example

    This example shows how to write a service plugin that manages textual notes by using a
    database to add, delete and store note objects. This plugin is QML compatible and is 
    therefore used in the example \l{declarative-sfw-notes}{Declarative Notes Manager} as 
    well as its non-QML counterpart \l{sfw-notes}{Notes Manager} which uses standard 
    user-interface files (*.ui).

    The data associated with this service is stored in \bold notesmanager.db in either the 
    default, current or home directory depending on user writing permissions.

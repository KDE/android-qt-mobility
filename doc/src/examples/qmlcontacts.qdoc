    \title Sample QML-based Phonebook Example

    \tableofcontents

    \section1 Phone Book

    This example shows how to write a simple read-only phonebook with the \l{Contacts}{Contacts API},
    with a user interface declared with the QML declarative language.

    \section2 Motivation
    This application was written to provide an example to developers of how to use the Qt Mobility Contacts API,
    and an example of integration with QML.

    \section2 Interface
    The interface is simplistic and merely provides an example that may provide a starting point
    for developers interested in designing QML-based interfaces for projects which use Qt Mobility APIs.

    \section2 Known Issues
    The example is not intended to be feature complete.  Only a very limited subset of detail types are
    supported by the application.  It exercises only a very small portion of the Qt Contacts API.
    The example is read-only and not performant.

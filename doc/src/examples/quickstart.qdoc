\example quickstart

\title Quickstart Example

The following steps outline how to make a simple 
"hello world" like application that uses Qt Mobility.
It is assumed that Qt Mobility has been
successfully built and environment variables have been set 
as per \l {Installation Guide}.

One can start using Qt Mobility with 3 simple steps.
\list 1
    \o Include the appropriate headers
    \o Use the \c QtMobility namespace
    \o Declare the usage of Qt Mobility
       and appropriate domain(s) in the project(.pro) file
\endlist

Steps 1 and 2 are shown in the example below:
\snippet quickstart/main.cpp 0

This example uses the QSystemInfo headers to print out the 
system's current country code.  All the domain APIs are wrapped
within the \c QtMobility namespace and thus developers either 
need to declare \c {using namespace QtMobility} or
qualify their symbols e.g. \c {QtMobility::QSystemInfo s}.
(\bold{Note}:  If you are on the Symbian platform you will
need to define the actual header file, in this case
<qsysteminfo.h> rather than using the standard header form
<QSystemInfo>, this is a known bug that is to be 
addressed in a future release)

In step 3, to specify that our project is using
System Information we declare in the project file:

\snippet quickstart/quickstart.pro 0

The project file states that the application uses
Qt Mobility and that it requires the 
System Information API. Internally this results
in qmake setting up the correct include and library paths.
For more details see \c {mobility.prf} (in \c{$QTDIR/mkspecs/features}).

The following table lists the domains and the 
corresponding values that can be assigned to
\c MOBILITY.
\table
\header
    \o Domain
    \o Value
\row
    \o \l {Bearer Management}
    \o bearer
\row
    \o \l {Contacts}
    \o contacts
\row
    \o \l {Location}
    \o location
\row
    \o \l {Multimedia}
    \o multimedia
\row
    \o \l {Messaging}
    \o messaging
\row
    \o \l {Publish And Subscribe}
    \o publishsubscribe
\row
    \o \l {Qt Service Framework} {Service Framework}
    \o serviceframework
\row
    \o \l {System Information}
    \o systeminfo
\row
    \o \l {Future Additional APIs}{Versit}
    \o versit
\endtable

And we're done.  If you are using the command line simply
enter:
\code
    qmake
    make
\endcode

to generate the executable which can then be run.

If you are developing for symbian,
to make a debug build for the emulator run:
\code
    qmake
    make debug-winscw
\endcode


To make a release build and SIS package for
a device run:
\code
    qmake
    make release-gcce
    make sis
\endcode

symbian see \l {http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6/symbian-with-qt-introduction.html} 
{The Symbian Platform - Introduction to Qt}, \l {http://developer.symbian.org/wiki/index.php/Qt_Quick_Start}
{Qt Quick Start} and the \c {symbian\install.txt}

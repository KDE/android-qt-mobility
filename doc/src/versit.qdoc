\section1 Overview 
Versit API provides a set of methods to parse/read (\l{QVersitReader}) and
encode/write (\l{QVersitWriter}) Versit* documents such as vCards
(\l http://www.imc.org/pdi/).
Currently \l{QVersitReader} and \l{QVersitWriter} support
reading and writing vCard 2.1 and 3.0 formats.

Versit API also provides utilities to import (\l{QVersitContactImporter})
QContacts from Versit documents and export (\l{QVersitContactExporter})
QContacts to Versit documents.

\title Versit API
\brief An API to manage Versit documents.
\ingroup mobility

\tableofcontents

\section1 Namespace

The QtMobility APIs are placed into the \i{QtMobility} namespace. This is done
to facilitate the future migration of Mobility APIs into Qt. See the
\l {Quickstart Example}{Quickstart guide} for an example on how the
namespace impacts on application development.

\section1 Overview
The Versit API provides a library to convert \l{QContact}{QContacts} to and from
\l{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vcard}{vCard} files.

vCards are represented abstract form with the QVersitDocument class.  vCard
files can be parsed into QVersitDocument form using QVersitReader.
QVersitDocument objects can be written to an I/O device using QVersitWriter.

\l{QVersitDocument}{QVersitDocuments} can be converted to
\l{QContact}{QContacts} using QVersitContactImporter.  \l{QContact}{QContacts}
can be converted to \l{QVersitDocument}{QVersitDocuments} using
QVersitContactExporter.

Currently \l{QVersitReader} and \l{QVersitWriter} support reading and writing
vCard 2.1 and vCard 3.0 format documents.  

Versit \reg is a trademark of the Internet Mail Consortium.

\section1 Usage
The following example goes through the process of reading a vCard and importing
it to QContact format, then exporting and writing it back out.

First, let's create some data to read.  In this case, we create a QBuffer as a demonstration, but
any QIODevice will work.
\snippet ../../doc/src/snippets/qtversitdocsample/qtversitdocsample.cpp Complete example - create

QVersitReader can be used to parse a vCard or iCalendar from an I/O device to
produce a list of QVersitDocuments.
\snippet ../../doc/src/snippets/qtversitdocsample/qtversitdocsample.cpp Complete example - read

QVersitDocuments aren't very useful to the QtContacts API.  They need to be imported using the
QVersitContactImporter.
\snippet ../../doc/src/snippets/qtversitdocsample/qtversitdocsample.cpp Complete example - import

Conversely, QVersitContactExporter can be used to convert from QContacts to QVersitDocuments.
\snippet ../../doc/src/snippets/qtversitdocsample/qtversitdocsample.cpp Complete example - export

To complete the exporting process, QVersitWriter can be used to write to an I/O device.
\snippet ../../doc/src/snippets/qtversitdocsample/qtversitdocsample.cpp Complete example - write

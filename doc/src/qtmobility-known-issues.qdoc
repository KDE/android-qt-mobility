\section1 Known Issues

\section2 Issues Affecting All Platforms
\list
    \o Messaging filtering and Sorting functions are not fully optimized.
    \o Camera support classes in Multimedia API is in technology preview state.
    \o Versit support for Contacts API is in technology preview state, see \c {src/versit/README}.
    \o Sensors API is in technology preview state.
    \o Not all example applications will display(fit) well on small screens.
\endlist

\section2 Symbian/S60 Specific

Currently it is not possible to use Qt convenience header includes:

\code
    #include <QSystemInfo> //does not work on Symbian
    //use
    #include <qsysteminfo.h>
\endcode

\section3 Bearer Management
No specific issues to highlight.


\section3 Contacts API
\list
    \o Async contact operations not supported
    \o Support for SIM contacts is not supported
    \o Extending contact fields at runtime is not supported on most Symbian platforms because would compromise compatibility with the S60 platform Phonebook application.
    \o auto test failures for tst_qcontactasync and tst_qcontactmanager
    \o samplephonebook not operating properly due to backend problems
\endlist


\section3 Location API
No specific issues to highlight.


\section3 Messaging API
\list
    \o Exporting IMAP or POP3 Message Updates from client to server is not supported
    \o Only one level of folders is supported <=> Symbian/S60 applications do not use nested folders
    \o Complex filter cases are not supported where nested filters are used (for example: \c {QMessageFilter::byParentAccountId(const QMessageAccountFilter ,...)}
    \o ReceptionTimeStamp is not supported in filtering <=> Symbian reports only one date for SMS & MMS which means that \c {QMessage::date()} field is used, not \c {receivedDate()})
    \o Message size reporting should be improved
    \o Preferred charsets handling auto test cases do not pass
    \o Cc address handling does not pass all auto test cases
    \o Multipart message body/attachment content type handling does not pass all auto test cases (problems with .png content)
    \o \c replyToAll functionality does not pass "to" & "cc" field auto test
    \o Local services messages, for example bluetooth, are listed/read in Inbox
\endlist

Several failing autotests.


\section3 System Info API
\list
    \o Battery status incorrect on test applications startup
    \o Phone is still charging but power state shows 100% and "wall power"

\section2 Windows Mobile Specific

\section3 Contacts API
The samplephonebook application has the following limitations
\list
    \o Adding a Contact Group fails.
    \o Adding an Avatar to a contact fails.

\endlist
    

\section3 Messaging API
For the QMessageServiceAction class the following limitations apply to this release:
\list
    \o \c {QMessageServiceAction::exportUpdates} : Full account synchronization currently unavailable due to lack of synchronous 
    control of update progress.
    \o \c {QMessageSerivceAction::retrieve} : Only retrieves content for messages bodies at present. Attachment retrieval 
    overridden by mapi/mail client settings.
    \o \c {QMessageServiceAction::cancelOperation} : Async nature of native calls used to implement service actions means that 
    cancelOperation will only operate on  \c ::retieveBody at present.
    \o \c {QMessageServiceAction::send}: Provides no way of determining actual transmission failure.
\endlist


\section2 Windows Specific
\list
    \o Windows Mobile backend only tested with Windows Mobile 6.0 Standard and Professional Edition with MSVC 2008.
    \o Windows Desktop backend only tested with Windows XP win32-msvc2008, and is not officially supported.
    \o Windows All Platforms \c {QMessageServiceAction::queryMessages} does not incrementally emit matching message identifiers or progress information.
    \o Windows All Platforms \c {QMessageStore::instance} shows a blocking modal dialog if MAPI is not installed.

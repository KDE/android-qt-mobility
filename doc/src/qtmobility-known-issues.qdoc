\section1 Known Issues

\section2 Non-API specific issues
\list
    \o Qt Mobility does not compile if Qt using a namespace
    \o Not all example applications will display(fit) well on small screens
    \o On S60, it is currently not possible to use Qt convenience header includes:
    \code
        #include <QSystemInfo> //does not work on Symbian
        //use
        #include <qsysteminfo.h>
    \endcode
\endlist

\section2 Contacts API
\list
    \o S60: Async contact operations not supported
    \o S60: Extending contact fields at runtime is not supported on most Symbian platforms because would compromise compatibility with the S60 platform Phonebook application.
\endlist

\section2 Location API
\list
    \o Maemo: backends are not yet fully implemented.
\endlist

\section2 Messaging API
\list
    \o Messaging filtering and Sorting functions are not fully optimized.
    \o Maemo: Messaging backends are not fully implemented.
    \o S60: Exporting IMAP or POP3 Message Updates from client to server is not supported
    \o S60: Only one level of folders is supported <=> Symbian/S60 applications do not use nested folders
    \o S60: Complex filter cases are not supported where nested filters are used (for example: \c {QMessageFilter::byParentAccountId(const QMessageAccountFilter ,...)}
    \o S60: ReceptionTimeStamp is not supported in filtering <=> Symbian reports only one date for SMS & MMS which means that \c {QMessage::date()} field is used, not \c {receivedDate()})
    \o S60: Message size reporting should be improved
    \o S60: Local services messages, for example bluetooth, are listed/read in Inbox
    \o Windows: \c {QMessageServiceAction::queryMessages} does not incrementally emit matching message identifiers or progress information.
    \o Windows: \c {QMessageStore::instance} shows a blocking modal dialog if MAPI is not installed.
    \o Windows mobile: \c {QMessageServiceAction::exportUpdates} : Full account synchronization currently unavailable due to lack of synchronous
    control of update progress.
    \o Windows mobile: \c {QMessageSerivceAction::retrieve} : Only retrieves content for messages bodies at present. Attachment retrieval
    overridden by mapi/mail client settings.
    \o Windows mobile: \c {QMessageServiceAction::cancelOperation} : Async nature of native calls used to implement service actions means that
    cancelOperation will only operate on  \c ::retieveBody at present.
    \o Windows Mobile: \c {QMessageServiceAction::send}: Provides no way of determining actual transmission failure.
\endlist

\section2 Multimedia API
\list
    \o \bold {Camera support classes in Multimedia API is in technology preview state.}
    \o S60: S60 specific play list not supported
    \o S60: Radio related functionality not supported
    \o S60: Device specific play list management not supported.
    \o S60: Audio capture does not support currently any special features like format, encoding etc...
    \o S60: seeking is not working properly
    \o S60: video size does not remain constant in repeated plays
    \o S60: full screen video not working OK
    \o S60: Calling QStillImageCapture::capture() with an existing file name results in Symbian:-11 error.
    \o Windows desktop: wmp multimedia plugin does not display video with Windows Media Player 10 or 12
\endlist

\section2 Publish and Subscribe API
\list
    \o Maemo: only supports subscribing but not publishing.
\endlist

\section2 Sensors API

    \o \bold {Sensors API is in technology preview state.}
\endlist

\section2 System Info API
\list
    \o S60: Battery status incorrect on test applications startup.
    \o S60: Phone is still charging but power state shows 100% and "wall power".

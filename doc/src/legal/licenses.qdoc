    \brief Information about other licenses used for Qt components and third-party code.

    Qt contains some code that is not provided under the
    \l{GNU General Public License (GPL)},
    \l{GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)} or the
    \l{Qt Commercial Editions}{Qt Commercial License Agreement}, but rather under
    specific licenses from the original authors. Some pieces of code were developed
    by Nokia and others originated from third parties.
    This page lists the licenses used, names the authors, and links
    to the places where it is used.

    Nokia gratefully acknowledges these and other contributions
    to Qt. We recommend that programs that use Qt also acknowledge
    these contributions, and quote these license statements in an
    appendix to the documentation.

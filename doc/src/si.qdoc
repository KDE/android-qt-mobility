\title System Information
\brief A set of APIs to discover system related information and capabilities.

\ingroup mobility

\tableofcontents

\section1 Namespace

The QtMobility APIs are placed into the \i{QtMobility} namespace. This is done
to facilitate the future migration of QtMobility APIs into Qt. See the
\l {Quickstart guide} for an example on how the
namespace impacts on application development.

\section1 System Information

The System Information API provides a set of APIs to discover system
related information and capabilities.

\section1 Overview
The System Information API returns the system information related to a
number of categories.

\section2 Information Categories

\section3 \bold{Version}

Contains version information for a range of supporting software on the
device. For example, from the Operating System and Firmware to the version
of WebKit, Qt and the Service Framework.

\section3 \bold{Features (hardware)}

This lists the supported hardware on the device. Features include items
such as the camera, bluetooth, GPS, FM radio etc.


\section3 \bold{Network}

The state of the network connection, and also the type of network e.g.
gsm, cdma, ethernet etc.


\section3 \bold{Display Information}

This provides height, width, contrast, and other information of the display.

\section3 \bold{Storage Information}
The presence of various storage devices. Including: none, internal,
removable, cdrom.

\section3 \bold{Device Information}
\list
    \o Battery Status
    \o Power State
    \o Profile (silent, vibrating, normal etc)
    \o Sim
    \o Input Method (key/buttons, keypad, qwerty, single touch screen,
multitouch etc)
\endlist


\section3 \bold{Screensaver}

This provides the access to the information of the screen saver.

\section1 Building and compiling

To build the library, run \tt configure and \tt make.

Linux supports a NetworkManager based backend and generic backend using
QNetworkInterface only. By default the generic backend is selected.
If the NetworkManager backend is required run qmake as follows:

\code
    qmake BACKEND=NetworkManager
\endcode

The backend selection is expected to disappear once the API is integrated into Qt.

\section1 QML Elements

The Qt SystemInfo offers access to system information through declarative
UI by providing systeminfo elements. Detailed information can be found
at \l{QML System Information Plugin}.

\annotatedlist qml-systeminfo


\section1 Examples

\section2 System Information Example

The \l{sysinfo}{System Information} example demonstrates how an application can very easily access the system information of the device.

\section2 System Information QML Example

 * Helper class to handle multiple async queries at the same time inside TrackerChangeListener.
 * This class is designed to be generic, and initially used to get all contacts that correspond
 * to list of IMAccounts. When we get signal that multiple IMAccounts have changed, we read
 * all contacts and emit signal contacts changed for them.
 *
 * Usage: construct AsyncQuery with RDFSelect query. When signal queryReady(AsyncQuery *self)
 * is received, read data from rows in self->nodes (self-nodes()->rowCount() ...)
 *
 * Intention: The class has been created to wrap LiveNodes::modelUpdated signal,
 * and to know which query it corresponds to (not possible to fetch it from sender()).
 * \sa queryReady(AsyncQuery *)

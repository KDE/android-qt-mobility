This folder subdivides into three different subfolders. 
The testcases use some experimental QML libraries and cannot be ran as autotests.

--- algorihmic 
Contains non-visual tests (~the traditional autotest).

1) Install the qtest-qml library. 
http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-labs/qtest-qml
See the README file of the project for instructions.
2) Modify the .pro file according to your installation (the 
qtest-qml.pro -file needs to be found) by adjusting the 
FIND_TOP variable.
3) Make and execute the test.
The .qml files prefixed with 'tst_' will be scanned and ran when running the
resulting testbinary,

--- visual 
Contains visual QML tests. Manual interactions and resulting visuals are recorded with 
qmlviewer and then replayed and verified.

During replay, qmlviewer is invoked as processes so expect to see coming and going 
QML windows. The reason forcing qmlviewer is that the needed Qt.VisualTest plugin is baked into the 
viewer. In future (fingers crossed) the plugin may be yanked as a separate plugin and be thus 
used also in other test frameworks.

--- manual
Contains manual QML applications for all sort of manual hack and slash exploratory testing.

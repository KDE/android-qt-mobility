This is a little app for testing the partial save functionality of the
QContactManager.

If you click Reload, the first contact in the manager will be loaded into the
UI.

Change some text in the fields and click one of the Save buttons.  Only the
field that was saved should be persisted.  You can verify this by clicking
Reload again.

Note that the app updates the QContact with the contents of every field in the
UI, and the entire QContact is passed into the manager when Save is clicked.  It
therefore relies on the partial save functionality of the manager to ensure that
only one of the fields is persisted.

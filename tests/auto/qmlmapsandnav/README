This testcase uses experimental qtest-qml QML testing library. 
It is not yet run as part of CI integration because running the test requires manual steps:

1) Install the qtest-qml library. 
http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-labs/qtest-qml
See the README file of the project for instructions.

2) Modify the .pro file according to your installation (the 
qtest-qml.pro -file needs to be found) by adjusting the 
FIND_TOP variable.

3) Make and execute the test.

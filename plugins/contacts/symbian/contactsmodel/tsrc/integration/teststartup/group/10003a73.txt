# Overview of data format
# Default view definitions are stored in two 'tables', each of which occupies
# a range of key values to allow room for extra entries in the future.
#
# The lower 8 bits (0x000000FF) represent the column number (max. 256).
# The next 8 bits (0x0000FF00) represent the row number (max. 256).
# The next 8 bits (0x00FF0000) represent the table number (max.256).
#
# The view definition table uses the range 0x00010000-0x0001FFFF.
# It consists of five columns: 
# Name			C++ Type		Key Type	Notes
# View Type		TViewType		int		Either 0 (anonymous remote view) or 1 (named remote view)
# View Name		TDesC			string		The remote view name.
# Sort Plugin Name	TDesC8			string8		Name of the sort plugin for the view.
# View Preferences	TContactViewPreferences	int		See description of data type in the SDK.
# Sort Order Index	-			int		Index in the sort order table of the
#								row which is the sort order for this
#								view definition.
#
# The sort order table uses the range 0x00020000-0x0002FFFF.
# Each row of the table consists of the contact field Uids from
# the RContactViewSortOrder of the view definition. Each Uid is
# stored unchanged from the values defined in cntdef.hrh.

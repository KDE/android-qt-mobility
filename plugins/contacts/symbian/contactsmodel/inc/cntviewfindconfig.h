/** An interface class that enables implementers to configure the way in which 
words are matched in CContactViewBase::ContactsMatchingCriteriaL() and CContactViewBase::ContactsMatchingPrefixL().

By default these two functions use TDesC16::MatchC() to do the matching, but 
where this is not appropriate, for instance in Chinese locales, a plug-in 
that implements this interface should be supplied. The plug-in's UID should 
be passed to CContactViewBase::SetViewFindConfigPlugin(), then the plug-in 
will be loaded when ContactsMatchingCriteriaL() or ContactsMatchingPrefixL() 
is called. Note that the plug-in is only loaded once per view, not each time 
a find is requested. Note also that the plug-in is optional. If no plug-in 
is supplied, TDesC16::MatchC() is used instead.

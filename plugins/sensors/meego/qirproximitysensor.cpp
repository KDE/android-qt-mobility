/*!
    \class QIRProximityReading
    \ingroup sensors_reading
    \inmodule QtSensors

    \brief The QIRProximityReading class holds readings from the IR proximity sensor.

    The IR (infra-red) proximity sensor detects proximity by beaming out infra-red light
    and detecting how much of the light returns.

    The biggest limitation of this technology is that there is no reliable way to turn the
    reflectance values into distances unless both the item being detected and the ambient
    conditions are known.

    \section2 QIRProximityReading Units

    The sensor reports reflectance as a percentage. That is, 0 indicates nothing was detected
    within the range of the sensor and 100 indicates the infra-red signal returned at the full
    power level that it was sent at.
*/

/*!
    \property QIRProximityReading::reflectance
    \brief Holds the reflectance value.

    The reflectance is a percentage (from 0 to 100) indicating how much of the transmitted
    infra-red light was returned.

    \brief The QIRProximityFilter class is a convenience wrapper around QSensorFilter.

    The only difference is that the filter() method features a pointer to QIRProximityReading
    instead of QSensorReading.

    \brief The QIRProximitySensor class is a convenience wrapper around QSensor.

    The only behavioural difference is that this class sets the type properly.

    This class also features a reading() function that returns a QIRProximityReading instead of a QSensorReading.

    For details about how the sensor works, see \l QIRProximityReading.

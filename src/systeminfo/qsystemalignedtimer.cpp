  \class QSystemAlignedTimer

  \inmodule QtSystemInfo
  \brief The QSystemAlignedTimer class provides a service for applications to synchronize their activity.

  QSystemAlignedTimer is a fuzzy timer that allows applications that must do periodic activity like
  after being in sleep mode a certain period, to synchronize their activities in the same window of time.

  For example send network "alive" messages at the same time (i.e. turn the wireless radio on at the same time).

  The service is not only for network-aware applications, it is for use by any applications
  that need to periodic wake-ups.

  The recommended use case is when app uses single-shot timer only: set mintime 0 for the first call
  'to jump to the train' and mintime > 0 after 1st wakeup.

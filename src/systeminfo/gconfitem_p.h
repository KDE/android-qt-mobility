/*!

  \brief GConfItem is a simple C++ wrapper for GConf.

  Creating a GConfItem instance gives you access to a single GConf
  key.  You can get and set its value, and connect to its
  valueChanged() signal to be notified about changes.

  The value of a GConf key is returned to you as a QVariant, and you
  pass in a QVariant when setting the value.  GConfItem converts
  between a QVariant and GConf values as needed, and according to the
  following rules:

  - A QVariant of type QVariant::Invalid denotes an unset GConf key.

  - QVariant::Int, QVariant::Double, QVariant::Bool are converted to
    and from the obvious equivalents.

  - QVariant::String is converted to/from a GConf string and always
    uses the UTF-8 encoding.  No other encoding is supported.

  - QVariant::StringList is converted to a list of UTF-8 strings.

  - QVariant::List (which denotes a QList<QVariant>) is converted
    to/from a GConf list.  All elements of such a list must have the
    same type, and that type must be one of QVariant::Int,
    QVariant::Double, QVariant::Bool, or QVariant::String.  (A list of
    strings is returned as a QVariant::StringList, however, when you
    get it back.)

  - Any other QVariant or GConf value is essentially ignored.

  \warning GConfItem is as thread-safe as GConf.

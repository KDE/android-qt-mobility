    \class QLandmarkIdFetchRequest
    \brief The QLandmarkIdFetchRequest class allows a client to asynchronously
    request a list of landmark identifiers from a landmark manager.

    For a QLandmarkIdFetchRequest, the resultsAvailable() signal will be emitted when the resultant
    manager-local contact ids (which may be retrieved by calling ids()), are updated, as well as if
    the overall operation error (which may be retrieved by calling error()) is updated.

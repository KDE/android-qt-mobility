    \class QMessageService

    \ingroup messaging

    \brief The QMessageService class provides the interface for requesting 
    messaging service operations.

    QMessageService provides the mechanisms for messaging clients to request services, 
    and to receive information in response.  All requestable service operations present 
    the same interface for communicating status, and progress information.

    All service request operations communicate changes in their operational state 
    by emitting the stateChanged() signal.

    Service request operations report progress information by emitting the 
    progressChanged() signal.
    
    If a requested operation fails after being initiated then the error() 
    function will return a value indicating the failure mode encountered.
    
    A client may attempt to cancel a requested operation after it has been 
    initiated. The cancel() slot is provided for this purpose.  Cancelation
    is not guaranteed to succeed, and is not possible on all platforms.

    A QMessageService instance supports only a single request at a time. Attempting 
    to initiate an operation on a QMessageService while another operation is already 
    in progress will result in function initiating the latter request returning 
    false. A client may, however, use multiple QMessageService instances to 
    concurrently initiate a queue of requests that will be serviced sequentially.

    Each QMessageService instance will report only the changes pertaining to 
    the request that instance initiated.

    Except where noted QMessageServices may initiate network activity. 
    Other functions in the mobility messaging API will not initiate network 
    activity, with the exception of Windows mobile and desktop platforms which 
    may initiate network activity during the evaluation of any function call.

/*!
    \enum QMessageService::State

    This enum type is used to describe the state of the requested operation.

    \value InactiveState    The operation has not yet begun execution.
    \value ActiveState      The operation is currently executing.
    \value CanceledState    The operation was canceled.
    \value FinishedState    The operation has finished execution; succesfully completed or otherwise.

    \fn QMessageService::QMessageService(QObject *parent)
  
    Constructs a message service representation object.
    
    The \a parent is passed to the QObject constructor.

/*!
    \fn QMessageService::queryMessages(const QMessageFilter &filter, const QMessageSortOrder &sortOrder, uint limit, uint offset)
    
    Emits via messagesFound() signals \l{QMessageId}s of messages in the messaging 
    store. If \a filter is not empty only identifiers for messages matching the parameters 
    set by \a filter will be emitted, otherwise identifiers for all messages will be emitted.
    If \a sortOrder is not empty, then the identifiers will be sorted by the parameters 
    set by \a sortOrder.
    If \a limit is not zero, then \a limit places an upper bound on the number of 
    ids in the list returned.
    \a offset specifies how many ids to skip at the beginning of the list returned.
    
    Calling this function may result in the messagesFound() and progressChanged() 
    signals  being emitted multiple times. An emission of the progressChanged()
    signal with a total of 0 indicates that the number of progress steps is
    unknown.
    
    The performance of querying messages is currently significantly less than 
    optimal for some querying criteria on some platforms.
    
    Returns true if the operation can be initiated; otherwise returns false.

    Note: This function should not initiate network activity, instead only message data
    already stored on the device will be used during evaluation of the function.

    otherwise identifiers for all messages with a body containing \a body using 
    matching flags \a matchFlags will be emitted.

    Emits via a messagesCounted() signal the number messages in the messaging

/*!
    \fn QMessageService::send(QMessage &message)
  
    Transmit \a message using the account identified by the message's \l{QMessage::parentAccountId()}{parentAccountId} function.
    If the message does not have a valid parentAccountId, it will be set to the 
    result of QMessageAccount::defaultAccount() for the message's \l{QMessage::Type}{type}.
    
    The message will be stored in the standard Outbox folder for the account before
    transmission, or moved to that folder if it is already stored in another folder.
    If transmission is successful, the message will be moved to the standard Sent
    folder for the account.
    
    Currently on the Maemo 5 (Fremantle) and Windows Mobile platforms the service 
    action object enters the FinishedState when the message is queued for sending 
    rather than actually sent.

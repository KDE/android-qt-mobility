  \class QContactRelationship
  \brief The QContactRelationship class describes a one-to-one relationship
  between a locally-stored contact and another (possibly remote) contact.
  \ingroup contacts-main
 
  Each relationship is uniquely identified by the combination of the first
  contact id, second contact id, and the relationship type.
 
  A relationship should not contain a second contact which is the same as
  the first contact.
  Any local contacts which are referenced in the relationship (that is, any
  source contact, or any second contact whose manager URI is left empty or
  whose manager URI references the manager that stores the source contact,
  and in which the relationship will be saved) should exist.
 
  If any of these requirements are not met, validation of the relationship
  may fail when attempting to save the relationship in a QContactManager.

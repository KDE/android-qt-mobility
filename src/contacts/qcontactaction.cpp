  \class QContactAction
  \brief The QContactAction class provides an interface for performing an
  action on a QContact or QContactDetail.
  \ingroup contacts-main
  \ingroup contacts-actions

  An action is anything that can be performed on a contact, or a detail of a contact.  An example
  of an action might be "Send Email" or "Dial" or "Plot Navigation Route".  One action may be
  implemented by multiple vendors, and indeed one vendor may provide multiple implementations of
  the same action.  The name of an action identifies its semantics, while its implementation version
  distinguishes it from other implementations of the action by the same vendor.

  Invocation of an action is asynchronous; at some stage after calling \l invokeAction() the
  action instance will emit the \l stateChanged() signal.  Any results of the action may be retrieved
  by calling \l results(), and as results become available the action will emit \l resultsAvailable().

  Each instance of a QContactAction is created by a \l QContactActionFactory when
  \l QContactActionFactory::instance() is called; the caller takes ownership of the action instance.
 
  \sa QContactActionFactory, QContactActionFilter

/*!
  \fn QContactAction::~QContactAction()
  Clears any memory in use by this instance of the action implementation
 */

/*!
  \fn QContactAction::actionDescriptor() const
  Returns the descriptor which uniquely identifies this action implementation.  A descriptor
  consists of an action name, a vendor name and an implementation version.
  The name of the action identifies the action provided; different implementations of an action
  with the same name must provide the same functionality, but may differ in implementation semantics.
  Hence, the action name includes the major version of the interface definition implemented.
  The vendor name is the identification string of the vendor which has provided this implementation.
  The implementation version is the (minor) version of the implementation, and is vendor-specific.

  \sa QContactActionDescriptor
 */

/*!
  \fn QContactAction::state() const
  Returns the current state of the action.
  \sa stateChanged()
 */

/*!
  \fn QContactAction::contactFilter(const QVariant& value) const
  Returns a filter which may be used to filter contacts by the availability of this action implementation for them.
  If \a value is valid, only contacts which have a detail with the given value and for which the action is available are returned
 */

/*!
  \fn QContactAction::isTargetSupported(const QContactActionTarget& target) const
  Returns true if the provided \a target contains the information required for this action to be
  performed on it; otherwise, returns false.
  Some actions may require no details to be specified (e.g., serialize entire contact), some may require
  exactly one detail (e.g., email this specific email account of the given contact), some may require
  zero or one detail (e.g., email exactly on email account of the given contact, but the action can choose
  which email account to email), some may require multiple details (e.g., email all specified email accounts
  of the given contact).  In all cases, it is the action which decides how much information it needs.
  If the target contains the required information, the function will return true; otherwise, returns false.
 */

/*!
  \fn QContactAction::invokeAction(const QContact& contact, const QContactDetail& detail = QContactDetail(), const QVariantMap& parameters = QVariantMap())
  Initiates the implemented action on the specified \a detail of the given \a contact, or on the first
  eligible detail saved in the contact if the given \a detail is empty, with the given \a parameters specified.
  At some point after invocation, one or more \l resultsAvailable() signals will be emitted by the action instance.
  The results of the action (if any) may be retrieved by calling \l results().
  When the state of the action changes, the \l stateChanged() signal will be emitted.

  Returns true if the action was invoked successfully, otherwise false.  The return value says nothing
  about whether the action which was invoked was successful or not, only whether it was initiated or
  the request for it to be initiated was sent successfully (e.g., if the action is implemented as a one-way
  RPC call).

  \sa results(), stateChanged()
 */

/*!
  \fn QContactAction::results() const
  Returns the result of the action, if any exists.  Calling this function prior to receiving the \l resultsAvailable()
  signal will not return a meaningful result.

  Describes the current status of the asynchronous action operation
  \value InactiveState The operation has not yet been initiated
  \value FinishedDetachedState The operation was initiated but no further information is or will be available
  \value ActiveState The operation was initiated and is not yet finished
  \value FinishedState The operation successfully completed
  \value FinishedWithErrorState The operation has finished, but an error occurred
 */

/*!
  \fn QContactAction::resultsAvailable()
  This signal is emitted by an action instance whose functionality has been initiated with \l invokeAction()
  when results of the action are available.  Not all actions will have results, and these
  actions will not emit the resultsAvailable() signal.

  If the action implementation is incapable of reporting results of the operation (for example, the
  action is implemented via a one-way IPC call) it should transition to the \c QContactAction::FinishedDetachedState state
  immediately upon invocation.

  This signal is emitted when the state of an action changes to the given \a newState.

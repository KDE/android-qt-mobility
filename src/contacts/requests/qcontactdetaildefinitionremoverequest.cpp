  \class QContactDetailDefinitionRemoveRequest
  \brief The QContactDetailDefinitionRemoveRequest class allows a client to
  asynchronously request that certain detail definitions be removed from
  a contacts store.

  For a QContactDetailDefinitionRemoveRequest, the resultsUpdated() signal will be emitted when
  the individual item errors (which may be retrieved by calling errorMap()) are updated, or if the overall
  operation error (which may be retrieved by calling error()) is updated.

  Sets the type of contact for which detail definitions should be removed to \a contactType, and the names of the detail definitions to remove from the manager to \a names.
  Managers may store different definitions which are valid for different contact types, and so attempting to remove definitions with certain names may fail if no such
  definitions exist for contacts of the given contact type, or if \a contactType is empty.

  \class QContactDetailDefinitionRemoveRequest
  \brief The QContactDetailDefinitionRemoveRequest class allows a client to
  asynchronously request that certain detail definitions be removed from
  a contacts store.

  For a QContactDetailDefinitionRemoveRequest, the resultsUpdated() signal will be emitted when
  the individual item errors (which may be retrieved by calling errorMap()) are updated, or if the overall
  operation error (which may be retrieved by calling error()) is updated.

  Please see the class documentation of QContactAbstractRequest for more information about
  the usage of request classes and ownership semantics.

  \class QContactManager
  \brief The QContactManager class provides an interface which allows clients with access to contact information stored in a particular backend.
  \ingroup contacts-main
 
  This class provides adding, updating and removal of contacts.
  It also provides definitions for details and fields that can be found in contacts.
 */

/*!
  \fn QContactManager::dataChanged()
  This signal is emitted by the manager if its internal state changes, and it is unable to determine the changes
  which occurred, or if the manager considers the changes to be radical enough to require clients to reload all data.
  If this signal is emitted, no other signals will be emitted for the associated changes.
 */

/*!
  \fn QContactManager::contactsAdded(const QList<QContactLocalId>& contactIds)
  This signal is emitted at some point once the contacts identified by \a contactIds have been added to a datastore managed by this manager.
  This signal must not be emitted if the dataChanged() signal was previously emitted for these changes.
 */

/*!
  \fn QContactManager::contactsChanged(const QList<QContactLocalId>& contactIds)
  This signal is emitted at some point once the contacts identified by \a contactIds have been modified in a datastore managed by this manager.
  This signal must not be emitted if the dataChanged() signal was previously emitted for these changes.
 */

/*!
  \fn QContactManager::contactsRemoved(const QList<QContactLocalId>& contactIds)
  This signal is emitted at some point once the contacts identified by \a contactIds have been removed from a datastore managed by this manager.
  This signal must not be emitted if the dataChanged() signal was previously emitted for these changes.

  \fn QContactManager::relationshipsRemoved(const QList<QContactLocalId>& affectedContactIds)
  This signal is emitted at some point after relationships have eben removed from the manager which involve the contacts identified by \a affectedContactIds.
  This signal must not be emitted if the dataChanged() signal was previously emitted for these changes.
 */

/*!
  \fn QContactManager::selfContactIdChanged(const QContactLocalId& oldId, const QContactLocalId& newId)
  This signal is emitted at some point after the id of the self-contact is changed from \a oldId to \a newId in the manager.
  If the \a newId is the invalid, zero id, then the self contact was deleted or no self contact exists.
  This signal must not be emitted if the dataChanged() signal was previously emitted for this change.

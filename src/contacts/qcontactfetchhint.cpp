  \class QContactFetchHint
  \brief The QContactFetchHint class provides hints to the manager about which contact
  information needs to be retrieved in an asynchronous fetch request or a synchronous
  function call.

  All of the hints may be ignored at the discretion of the manager, however if a manager
  is able to optimize retrieval of contacts due to hints, it may do so.  If a manager
  ignores a hint, it must retrieve the full set of data that the hint refers to.

  The fetch hint contains:
  \list
   \o a list of detail definition names which the client is interested
  in (empty if interested in all detail definitions)
   \o a list of relationship types which the client is interested in
  (empty if interested in all relationships)
   \o some optimization flags which allow the client to tell the backend if they are
  not interested in any relationships, any action preferences, or any binary blobs (images etc).
  \endlist

  Important note: a client should not make changes to a contact which has been retrieved
  using a fetch hint other than the default fetch hint.  Doing so will result in information
  loss when saving the contact back to the manager (as the "new" restricted contact will
  replace the previously saved contact in the backend).
 */

/*!
  \enum QContactFetchHint::OptimizationHint

  This enum defines flags which may be set to inform the backend that the client does
  not require certain information.  The backend may safely ignore the hint, but then
  must return the full set of information relating to the optimization hint.

  \value AllRequired Tells the backend that all information is required
  \value NoRelationships Tells the backend that the client does not require retrieved contacts to include a cache of relationships
  \value NoActionPreferences Tells the backend that the client does not require retrieved contacts to include a cache of action preferences
  \value NoBinaryBlobs Tells the backend that the client does not require retrieved contacts to include binary blobs such as thumbnail images

    \brief The QGalleryAbstractResponse class provides a base class for
    responses to gallery requests.

    QGalleryAbstractResponse is the interface through which a QAbstractGallery
    returns a response to a QGalleryAbstractRequest.  The interface provides
    functions to communicate the state of a response to a request, additional
    classes derived from QGalleryAbstractRequest such as QGalleryResultSet are
    used to communicate actual results.

    New responses start in an active state indicating they have not yet
    finished.  When a response has finished; implementers should call the
    finish function which will put the response into an inactive state and
    emit the finished signal.  If the idle argument of finish is true then
    isIdle() will be true on return indicating that the response may return to
    an active state in order to refresh its results in the future.  The resume
    function will return the response to an active state and emit the resumed
    signal.

    If a response cannot finish successfully then implementers should call the
    error() function and supply an error code and description.  This will finish
    the request and set values for error() and errorString().

    If a request is cancelled it will call cancel() on its response.  The
    base implementation wsets isActive() and isIdle() to false and emits
    the canceled signal, so implementers will need to override the default
    implementation to actually cancel any ongoing task or suspend updates before
    calling the base implementation.  If the response can't be canceled
    synchronously then calling the base implementation should be deferred until
    the cancelation has completed.  Canceling a response should not discard any
    intermediate results already made available by the response.

    Unless a response finishes synchronously and calls finish() or error()
    from its constructor it must implement the waitForFinished() function
    to allow clients to block while waiting for the response to finish.

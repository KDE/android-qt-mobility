    \brief The QGalleryAbstractRequest class provides a base class for gallery
    requests.

    Gallery requests are the interface through which clients can interact with
    a gallery to execute queries or perform actions.  QAbstractGalleryRequest
    manages executing requests against a gallery and reporting the state of
    responses.

    In order to execute a request it is first necessary to assign the \l gallery
    to the request.  If the request is supported by the gallery the \l supported
    property will be true, otherwise if the request is not supported or no
    gallery is assigned to the request \l supported will be false.

    Once a request has been assigned a gallery and its own arguments it can be
    \l {execute()}{executed}.  As requests are asynchronous results will not
    be available immediately, instead the request will go into an \l Active
    \l state until it is finished.  If the request is successful the finished()
    signal will be emitted and if not the error() signal will be emitted, in
    both cases the stateChanged() signal will be emitted with the new state of
    the request.

    Active requests can be canceled by calling the cancel() function.
    Canceling a request can also be an asynchronous action and does not always
    prevent a request from finishing successfully such as when the earliest
    possible point to interrupt a request is on completion.  If a canceled
    request isn't aborted immediately it will go into the \l Canceling state
    until it is aborted and enters the \l Canceled state or succeeds and enters
    the \l Finished state.

    Some requests support automatically updating their results in response to
    changes in their source data or some other event.  A request that will
    provide these sort of updates will enter the Idle state upon finishing
    its initial request.  From the \l Idle state a request may return to the
    \l Active state itself to refresh its results or update it results
    immeditately if a a new query is not required.  Cancelling an idle request
    will put it into the \l Finished state and prevent future updates.

    While requests are asynchronous it is possible to use them in a synchronous
    manner by using the waitForFinished() function to block until the request
    has finished.

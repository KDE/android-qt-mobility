    \brief The QGalleryResource class provides a resource identifier for a
    gallery item.

    A gallery resource is URL and a set of disambiguating meta-data properties
    used to identify a single representation of a gallery item that may be
    accessible using multiple protocols or in multiple formats.  This may be
    useful when querying something like a media server which can serve the same
    video in multiple resolutions, instead of listing the same video multiple
    times it would list it only once but include a resource for each resolution.

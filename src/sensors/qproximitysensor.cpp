           proximity sensor.

    \target QProximityReading_Units
    The proximity sensor returns an indication of how far the user is
    away from the device using the pre-defined values found in the
    QProximityReading::Proximity enum.
*/

/*!
    \enum QProximityReading::Proximity

    This enum represents the proximity of the user.

    \value Undefined  The proximity is unknown.
    \value Close      The user is close to the device.
    \value NotClose   The user is not close to the device.

    The only difference is that the filter() method features a pointer to QProximityReading
    instead of QSensorReading.

    \preliminary
    \brief The QProximitySensor class is a convenience wrapper around QSensor.

    The only behavioural difference is that this class sets the type properly.

    This class also features a reading() function that returns a QProximityReading instead of a QSensorReading.

    For details about how the sensor works, see \l QProximityReading.

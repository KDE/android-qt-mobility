/*!
    \class QProximityReading
    \ingroup sensors_reading

    \preliminary
    \brief The QProximityReading class represents one reading from the
           proximity sensor.

    \target QProximityReading_Units
    The proximity sensor can only indicate if an object is close or not.

    The distance at which an object is considered close is device-specific. This
    distance may be available in the QSensor::outputRanges property.
*/

/*!
    \property QProximityReading::close
    \brief a value indicating if something is close.

    Set to true if something is close.
    Set to false is nothing is close.

    \sa QProximityReading_Units
*/

{
    return d->close;

    Sets the close value to \a close.

/*!
    \class QProximityFilter
    \ingroup sensors_filter

    \preliminary
    \brief The QProximityFilter class is a convenience wrapper around QSensorFilter.

    The only difference is that the filter() method features a pointer to QProximityReading
    instead of QSensorReading.
*/

/*!
    \fn QProximityFilter::filter(QProximityReading *reading)

    Called when \a reading changes. Returns false to prevent the reading from propagating.

    \sa QSensorFilter::filter()
*/

const char *QProximitySensor::type("QProximitySensor");

/*!
    \class QProximitySensor
    \ingroup sensors_type

    \preliminary
    \brief The QProximitySensor class is a convenience wrapper around QSensor.

    The only behavioural difference is that this class sets the type properly.

    This class also features a reading() function that returns a QProximityReading instead of a QSensorReading.

    For details about how the sensor works, see \l QProximityReading.

    \sa QProximityReading
*/

/*!
    \fn QProximitySensor::QProximitySensor(QObject *parent)

    Construct the sensor as a child of \a parent.
*/

/*!
    \fn QProximitySensor::~QProximitySensor()

    Destroy the sensor. Stops the sensor if it has not already been stopped.
*/

/*!
    \fn QProximitySensor::reading() const

    Returns the reading class for this sensor.

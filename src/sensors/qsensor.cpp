    \typedef qtimestamp
    \relates QSensor

    Sensor timestamps are represented by this typedef which is a 64 bit unsigned integer.

    Timestamps values are microseconds since a fixed point.
    You can use timestamps to see how far apart two sensor readings are.

    Note that sensor timestamps from different sensors may not be directly
    comparable (as they may choose different fixed points for their reference).

    \bold{Note that some platforms do not deliver timestamps correctly}.
    Applications should be prepared for occasional issues that cause timestamps to jump
    forwards or backwards. The \l{sensors-api.html#platform-notes}{platform notes} have
    more details.

    \brief The qoutputrange class holds the specifics of an output range.

    The class is defined as a simple struct.

    \code
    struct qoutputrange
    {
        qreal maximum;
        qreal minimum;
        qreal accuracy;
    };
    \endcode

    Each output range specifies a minimum and maximum value as well as an accuracy value.
    The accuracy value represents the resolution of the sensor. It is the smallest change
    the sensor can detect and is expressed using the same units as the minimum and maximum.

    Sensors must often trade off range for accuracy. To allow the user to determine which of
    these are more important the sensor may offer several output ranges. One output
    range may have reduced minimum and maximum values and increased sensitivity. Another output
    range may have higher minimum and maximum values with reduced sensitivity. Note that higher
    sensitivities will be represented by smaller accuracy values.

    An example of this tradeoff can be seen by examining the LIS302DL accelerometer. It has only
    256 possible values to report with. These values are scaled so that they can represent either
    -2G to +2G (with an accuracy value of 0.015G) or -8G to +8G (with an accuracy value of 0.06G).

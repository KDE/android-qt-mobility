    \class QAttitudeReading
    \ingroup sensors_reading

    \preliminary
    \brief The QAttitudeReading class represents one reading from the
           attitude sensor.

    \section2 QAttitudeReading Units
    The attitude sensor returns the attitude of the device. The terms used come
    from \l{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_dynamics}{flight dynamics}.
    The pitch of the device is the rotation around the X axis, the roll of the device
    is teh rotation around the Y axis and the yaw of the device is the rotation
    around the Z axis.

    \image Flight_dynamics_with_text.png

    \l{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flight_dynamics_with_text.png}

    All three values are measured in degrees but their range is limited so that a given
    attitude can be represented uniquely.

    \list
    \o Pitch: -90 to 90
    \o Roll: -180 to 180
    \o Yaw: 0 to 360
    \endlist

    Pitch and Roll will be at 0 when the phone is lying flat and face up. Yaw will
    be at 0 when the top of the phone is pointing towards the reference point.

    Note that yaw requires a fixed, external reference point that the device can
    detect. For example, devices with a compass may use magnetic north as
    a reference point. Devices that cannot detect a fixed, external reference
    point will always return 0 for yaw.

    The only behavioural difference is that this class sets the type properly.

    This class also features a reading() function that returns a QAttitudeReading instead of a QSensorReading.

    \class QTapReading
    \ingroup sensors_reading

    \preliminary
    \brief The QTapReading class represents one reading from the
           tap sensor.

    \section2 QTapReading Units
    The tap sensor registers tap and double tap events in one of the six directions.
    There are 3 axes that originate from the phone. They are arranged as follows.
\code
             +z

              |      +y

/*!
    \enum QTapReading::TapDirection

    The tap direction is reported as one of the six directions (X, Y, Z, positive and negative).
    There are 3 flags that you can use if you only care about the axis in use.

    \value Undefined This value means that the direction is unknown.
    \value X     This flag is set if the tap was along the X axis.
    \value Y     This flag is set if the tap was along the Y axis.
    \value Z     This flag is set if the tap was along the Z axis.
    \value X_Pos This value is returned if the tap was towards the positive X direction.
    \value Y_Pos This value is returned if the tap was towards the positive Y direction.
    \value Z_Pos This value is returned if the tap was towards the positive Z direction.
    \value X_Neg This value is returned if the tap was towards the negative X direction.
    \value Y_Neg This value is returned if the tap was towards the negative Y direction.
    \value Z_Neg This value is returned if the tap was towards the negative Z direction.

    The only behavioural difference is that this class sets the type properly.

    This class also features a reading() function that returns a QTapReading instead of a QSensorReading.

  \class QOrganizerItemDetailDefinitionSaveRequest
  \brief The QOrganizerItemDetailDefinitionSaveRequest class allows a client to
  asynchronously request that certain detail definitions be saved in an
  organizer item store manager.
  \inmodule QtOrganizer

  For a QOrganizerItemDetailDefinitionSaveRequest, the resultsAvailable() signal will be emitted when
  either the individual item errors (which may be retrieved by calling errorMap()), or the resultant
  detail definitions (which may be retrieved by calling definitions()), are updated, as well as if
  the overall operation error (which may be retrieved by calling error()) is updated.

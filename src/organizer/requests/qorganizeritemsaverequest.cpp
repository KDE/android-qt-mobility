  \class QOrganizerItemSaveRequest
  \brief The QOrganizerItemSaveRequest class allows a client to asynchronously
    request that certain organizer items be saved to an organizer item store.
  \inmodule QtOrganizer

  For a QOrganizerItemSaveRequest, the resultsAvailable() signal will be emitted when
  either the individual item errors (which may be retrieved by calling errorMap()), or the resultant
  organizer items (which may be retrieved by calling items()), are updated, as well as if
  the overall operation error (which may be retrieved by calling error()) is updated.

  \ingroup organizer-requests

    QOrganizerAbstractRequestPrivate::notifyEngine(this);

/*!
  Sets the organizer item to be saved to \a organizeritem.
  Equivalent to calling:

/*!
    Set the list of definitions to restrict saving to \a definitionMask.  This allows you to perform
    partial save (and remove) operations on existing items.

    If \a definitionMask is empty (the default), no restrictions will apply, and the passed
    in items will be saved as is.  Otherwise, only details whose definitions are in
    the list will be saved.  If a definition name is present in the list, but there are no
    corresponding details in the item passed into this request, any existing details in
    the manager for that item will be removed.

    This is useful if you've used a fetch hint to fetch a partial item from a manager
    so that you can save changes to the details you actually fetched without removing
    the details you didn't.

    Additionally, when performing synchronization operations with other managers that don't
    support the full range of details, you can restrict the update operation to only those
    details so that you don't lose the extra details that are supported in this manager.

    \note Some managers do not support partial updates natively, in which case the QtOrganizer
    framework will emulate the functionality (fetching the whole item, applying the
    new restricted details, and saving the item back).

  \class QOrganizerItemFetchRequest
  \brief The QOrganizerItemFetchRequest class allows a client to asynchronously
    request organizer items from an organizer item store manager.
  \inmodule QtOrganizer


  For a QOrganizerItemFetchRequest, the resultsAvailable() signal will be emitted when the resultant
  organizer item (which may be retrieved by calling items()), are updated, as well as if
  the overall operation error (which may be retrieved by calling error()) is updated.

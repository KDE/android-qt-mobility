// manages calendars; c.f. QContactManager

// a calendar consists of a series of related items, or items
// which concern a particular context; c.f. QContact

// a calendar manager may support different types of items,
// which may contain different types of information;
// c.f. QContactDetailDefinition
QCalendarItemDefinition

// a calendar item contains details of an event or note or
// appointment etc, which is valid for a particular context;
// c.f. QContactDetail?

// fetch a calendar or calendars; c.f. QContactFetchRequest
QCalendarFetchRequest

// this is a departure from QContact API
// Get any item (regardless of which calendar it's part of) that matches the criteria
// eg: get me any events/items which are for "week 26" regardless of which calendar..
// QUESTION: per-user calendars?  Do we need to link them to a particular contact?  Or..?

/*----------------------------------------------------------------

Open questions:
1) How can we allow use of different calendar systems (Gregorian vs Chinese vs Lunar vs..)
2) How can we allow migration of items (invitation -> event -> note -> journal -> ... )
    -> what is the difference between them from our point of view?
    -> do we need a QCalendarItem::Type?  which is mutable..?
    -> are the (possible) fields of an item determined by the item's type?
3) Do we want to allow aggregation of calendars?
    -> eg, have two calendars "2010 Judo Calendar", "2010 Social Calendar"
        - first lists competition dates, training days, etc
        - second lists birthday parties, weddings, etc
        -> want to be able to create a "master calendar" by saying "aggregate these two and show me the clashes"
            - then manually resolve (mark a competition as "Not Going To Attend (have wedding to attend instead)")
    -> is this a UI issue as opposed to a calendar issue? 
        -> if so, need a way to mark a calendar item as "visible but not attending"...
        -> what possible states of attendance do we want?
            - attending
            - possibly attending <--- default?
            - not attending
        -> maybe we want priorities?
            - must attend
            - should attend
            - maybe attend
            - probably won't attend
            - won't attend
        -> is prioritisation different to attendance?
            - furthermore, want to be able to store _past_ items
            - so, "attended" and "didn't attend" and "partially attended"
4) recurrence
    -> how can we say that an item is a recurrent event?
    -> how much flexibility do we want?
    -> how does recurrence relate to marking an item as "attended"
        -> eg, lets say we have a recurrent "Tuesday Night: Judo Training" item
            - I attended last week, but this week I was injured, so missed it.
            - how do we save this information?
            - do we save this information?  maybe we cannot?
            - do we "autogenerate" the items as they occur?
                - ie, while it hasn't happened yet, it's the recurrent item, after it passes, a new (old/finished) item is created..?
5) Can calendar items be shared between calendars?
    -> does it make sense?
    -> what about QContact - two people living together, the detail isn't shared, it's duplicated
        -> this can lead to problems (update one information but not the other, seems like they don't live together any more..?)
        -> but simpler to implement..
6) Supported "types" of calendar items
    -> dynamically registerable via the item definitions, hopefully.
    -> invitiation, event, reminder, ToDo, note, ..?  what else?

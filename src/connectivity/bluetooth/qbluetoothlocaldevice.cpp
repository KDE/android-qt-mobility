    \class QBluetoothLocalDevice
    \brief The QBluetoothLocalDevice class provides access to local Bluetooth devices.

    \ingroup connectivity-bluetooth

    QBluetoothLocalDevice provides functions for getting and setting the state of local Bluetooth
    devices.

    \enum QBluetoothLocalDevice::Pairing

    This enum describes the pairing state between two Bluetooth devices.

    \value Unpaired         The Bluetooth devices are not paired.
    \value Paired           The Bluetooth devices are paired. The system will prompt the user for
                            authorization when the remote device initiates a connection to the
                            local device.
    \value AuthorizedPaired The Bluetooth devices are paired. The system will not prompt the user
                            for authorization when the remote device initiates a connection to the
                            local device.

  This enum describes errors that maybe returned

  \value NoError        No known error
  \value PairingError   Error in pairing
  \value UnknownError   Unknown error

*/

/*!
    \enum QBluetoothLocalDevice::HostMode

    This enum describes the most of the local Bluetooth device.

    \value HostPoweredOff       Powers the device down
    \value HostConnectable      Remote Bluetooth devices can connect to the local Bluetooth device
                                if they have previously been paired with it or otherwise know its
                                address. This powers up the device if it was powered off.
    \value HostDiscoverable     Remote Bluetooth devices can discover the presence of the local
                                Bluetooth device.  The device will also be connectable, and powered on.

  Signal by some platforms to display a pairing confirmation dialog for \a address.  The user
  is asked to confirm the \a pin is the same on both devices.  QBluetoothLocalDevice::pairingConfirmation(bool)
  must be called to indicate if the user accepts or rejects the displayed pin.

  To be called after getting a pairingDisplayConfirmation().  The \a accept parameter either
  accepts the pairing or rejects it.

  Signal by some platforms to display the \a pin to the user for \a address.  The pin is automatically
  generated, and does not need to be confirmed.
*/

/*!
  \fn QBluetoothLocalDevice::requestPairing(const QBluetoothAddress &address, Pairing pairing)
  Set the \a pairing status with \a address.  The results are returned via
  the signal pairingFinished().  Caution: creating a pairing may take minutes, and can require
  the user to acknowledge dialogs.

  Pairing has completed with \a address. Current pairing status is in \a pairing.

  Signal emited for pairing if there's an exceptional \a error

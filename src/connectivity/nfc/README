Near Field Communication (NFC)

The NFC API is under development and subject to change between the tech preview
and its official release with Qt Mobility 1.2. Unfortunately there are no
functional backend for real hardware for the technology preview. An emulation
backend is available, however, which is used by both the unit tests and the
Qt Simulator backend. To use the Qt Simulator backend a modified version of the
Qt Simulator is required. It is available at http://qt.gitorious.org/?????

What should work:

1. NDEF record and message parsing

2. NDEF record and message creation

3. NDEF notification

4. NFC Tag Type 1 tags are supported
    - NDEF reading
    - NDEF writing
    - Tag specific commands
    - Static and Dynamic memory models


What does NOT work:

1. Backends for real hardware: Symbian, MeeGo

2. LLCP Sockets

3. Other common tag technologies
    - NFC Tag Type 2
    - NFC Tag Type 3
    - NFC Tag Type 4
    - Mifare

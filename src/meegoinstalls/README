PATCHES
=======

At the time of writing, there are some MeeGo-specific patches hosted
on the MeeGo OBS.  These patches are unable to be hosted in the Mobility
git repository at this time.

In order to successfully build Mobility for MeeGo, you must also obtain
these patches.

Please do not add any more patches.

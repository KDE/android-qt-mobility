  \class QVersitWriter
  \preliminary
  \brief The QVersitWriter class writes Versit documents such as vCards to a device.
  \ingroup versit

  QVersitWriter converts a QVersitDocument into its textual representation.
  QVersitWriter supports writing to an abstract I/O device
  which can be for example a file or a memory buffer.
  The writing can be done asynchronously and the waitForFinished()
  function can be used to implement a blocking write.

  The serialization of the document is done in accordance with the type of the QVersitDocument
  being written.  The value of each QVersitProperty is encoded according to the type of object:
  \list
  \o \l{QString}{QStrings} are serialized verbatim, unless the default codec of the writer cannot
  encode the string: in this case, UTF-8 is used to encode it (and the CHARSET parameter added to
  the property, as per the vCard 2.1 specification).  If the document type is vCard 2.1,
  quoted-printable encoding may also be performed.
  \o \l{QByteArray}{QByteArrays} are assumed to be binary data and are serialized as base-64 encoded
  values.
  \o \l{QVersitDocument}{QVersitDocuments} are serialized as a nested document (eg. as per the
  AGENT property in vCard).

  \class QVersitContactImporter
  \brief The QVersitContactImporter class converts \l{QVersitDocument}{QVersitDocuments} to
  \l{QContact}{QContacts}.

  \ingroup versit

  This class is used to convert lists of \l{QVersitDocument}{QVersitDocuments} (which may be
  produced by a QVersitReader) to lists of \l{QContact}{QContacts} (which may be saved into a
  QContactManager.  Unless there is an error, there is a one-to-one mapping between Versit
  documents and QContacts.  The importer can be extended by clients by associating resource
  and property handlers.

  A \l QVersitResourceHandler is associated with the importer to supply the behaviour for saving
  files to persistent storage.  By default, this is set to a \l QVersitDefaultResourceHandler,
  which does not save files to persistent storage.  Note that although photos found in vCards
  are not saved to disk by default, the importer does add a QContactThumbnail detail to the
  image.  If a full-sized image needs to be loaded from a URL and persisted on disk, a custom
  QVersitResourceHandler should be supplied which implements this.

  By associating a QVersitContactImporterPropertyHandlerV2 with the importer using
  setPropertyHandler(), the client can pass in a handler to override the processing of properties
  and/or handle properties that QVersitContactImporter doesn't support.  A "backup" handler is
  provided by QVersitContactImporterPropertyHandlerV2::createBackupHandler() which imports
  properties generated by the corresponding backup handler for the QVersitContactExporter.

  An example usage of QVersitContactImporter:
  \snippet ../../doc/src/snippets/qtversitdocsample/qtversitdocsample.cpp Import example

  \section1 Importing categories
  The importer imports the vCard CATEGORIES property by converting each category to a QContactTag.
  Some managers may not have support for QContactTag, but instead support categorization using the
  \l{QContactRelationship::HasMember}{HasMember} QContactRelationship along with contacts of type
  \l{QContactType::TypeGroup}{TypeGroup}.  For these backends, if the categorization information
  needs to be retained through group relationships, extra work needs to be done to do the
  conversion.  Below is some example code that does this translation.

  \snippet ../../doc/src/snippets/qtversitdocsample/qtversitdocsample.cpp Import relationship example

  Constructs and returns a property handler that restores data from a vCard generated using the

  The caller is responsible for deleting the object.

  Clients wishing to implement their own property handler and also benefit from the functionality of
  the default handler can use this function to construct one, and wrap a custom
  QVersitContactImporterPropertyHandlerV2 around it.  In the implementation of propertyProcessed and
  documentProcessed, the respective functions in the backup handler should be called as the last
  step (ensuring the arguments are correctly updated and passed through).

    \class QAbstractSecuritySession
    \ingroup servicefw
    \brief The QAbstractSecuritySession class provides a generic mechanism to enable
    permission checks for services.
    
    QAbstractSecuritySession describes the abstract interface that security/permission
    engines must implement in order to provide capability related functionality.

    A QAbstractSecuritySession encapsulates the service client's capabilities. QServiceManager
    can match those capabilites with the capabilites required by a particular service. 
    Service capabilites are declared via the services XML description. 

    The use of a security session is not mandated by the service manager. If the client
    is passing a security session object QServiceManager ensures that the permissions
    are checked before the requested service is loaded and forwards the session to the 
    service in case the service intends to implement additional checks. If no security 
    session is passed to QServiceManager capability checks are not performed. Note that
    the security session is no substitute for platform security such as control over
    a processes ability to load arbitrary plug-ins.

    Since the service loader controls whether a security session is passed to the
    QServiceManager instance it is assumed that the calling context can be trusted. Possible
    use cases for a security session could be arbitrary Javascript applications which run
    within a trusted browser environment. The QAbstractSecuritySession interface would allow
    the browser to provide access to platform services while at the same time being able to
    ensure that certain Javascript application (depending on e.g their context, URL or signatures)
    can not access more sensitive system services.

    Framework clients with purely native code bases are likely to never have any security sessions.

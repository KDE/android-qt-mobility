/*!
    \namespace QService
    \ingroup servicefw

    \brief The QService namespace contains miscellaneous identifiers used throughout the
    Qt Service framework library.
*/

/*!
    \enum QService::Scope
    Defines the scope to be used when accessing services. Note that Symbian
    does not distinguish scopes and therefore UserScope and SystemScope may
    be used interchangeably.

    \value UserScope When adding and removing services, uses a storage location
    specific to the current user.
    When searching for services and interface implementations, first searches in the
    user-specific location; if the service or interface implementation
    is not found, searches in the system-wide storage location (if the user has
    sufficient permissions to do so).

    \value SystemScope When adding and removing services, use a system-wide
    storage location accessible to all users. When searching
    for services and interface implementations, search only in the system-wide
    storage location.

    \ingroup servicefw

    \brief The QService namespace contains miscellaneous identifiers used throughout the
    Qt Service framework library.
*/

/*!
    \enum QService::Scope
    Defines the scope to be used when accessing services. Note that Symbian
    does not distinguish scopes and therefore UserScope and SystemScope may
    be used interchangeably.

    \value UserScope When adding and removing services, uses a storage location
    specific to the current user.
    When searching for services and interface implementations, first searches in the
    user-specific location; if the service or interface implementation
    is not found, searches in the system-wide storage location (if the user has
    sufficient permissions to do so).

    \value SystemScope When adding and removing services, use a system-wide
    storage location accessible to all users. When searching
    for services and interface implementations, search only in the system-wide
    storage location.
*/

/*!
    \enum QService::UnrecoverableIPCError
    Defines the unrecoverable IPC error of the service 

    \value    ErrorUnknown                  An unknown IPC error.
    \value    ErrorServiceNoLongerAvailable Indicates that the service is no longer available.
    \value    ErrorOutofMemory              Indicates that the service is out of memoruy.
    \value    ErrorPermissionDenied         Indicates that the permission of this service is denied.
    \value    ErrorInvalidArguments         User uses invalid argument for this service.
*/

/*!
    \enum QService::Type
    Defines the type of the service 

    \value    Plugin          This denotes that the service is plug-in based.
    \value    InterProcess    This denotes that the service is deployed using IPC mechanisms 
                              available on the current platform, such as DBus or local sockets.

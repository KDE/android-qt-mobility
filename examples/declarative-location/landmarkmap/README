To import landmarks from a file, place the landmark file in the same folder with .qml
(e.g. "myImportedLandmarks.gpx" or change the filename accordingly in .qml if needed).

If you want to use NMEA log file, place the NMEA file in the same folder (e.g. 
"nmealog.txt or  change the filename accordingly in .qml if needed").

Note if you deploy for Symbian/WinCE, the filenames need to match with
deployment.pri

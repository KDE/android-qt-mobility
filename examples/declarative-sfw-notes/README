This example requires the example Notes Manager service to be registered in order 
for the application to obtain the default interface. This can be done by using the 
service framework command line tool to add the corresponding service XML file:

./servicefw add notesmanagerservice.xml

The XML files for all example services can be found in the QtMobility build directory
under install/bin/xmldata

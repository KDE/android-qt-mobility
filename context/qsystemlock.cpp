   \class QSystemReadWriteLock
    \inpublicgroup QtBaseModule

   \brief The QSystemReadWriteLock class provides read-write locking between
   processes.

   A read-write lock is a synchronization tool for protecting resources that can
   be accessed for reading and writing. This type of lock is useful if you want
   to allow multiple threads to have simultaneous read-only access, but as soon
   as one thread wants to write to the resource, all other threads must be
   blocked until the writing is complete.

   QSystemReadWriteLock behaves much like the QReadWriteLock class, but it also
   works across multiple processes (although it also works perfectly well, 
   albeit slightly less efficiently, in a single process).  In order to clean up
   the system resources used to coordinate cross process synchronization, one 
   QReadWriteLock instance is designated the lock "owner".  This instance 
   creates the required system resources, and removes them when it is destroyed.
   The lock owner should always be instantiated before any others.

   System locks are identified by a 32-bit integer, which allows other processes
   to share the same lock.  While the selection of this identifier is left
   upto the caller, under Linux it is common to use the ftok(3) function call
   which uses the identity of a specified file to generate such an identifier.

   For example, to create the lock owner:

   \code
   int id = (int)::ftok("/tmp/my_lock_identifier", 0);

   QSystemReadWriteLock lock(id, true);
   \endcode

   The file passed to ftok(3) is only used to generate a unique identifier for
   the lock and is otherwise unrelated to the lock.  It is possible, although 
   bad practice due to potential unintended clashes with other applications that
   do the same, to simply make up a number for the lock id.  

   Other applications can then easily create a non-owner reference to the lock:
   
   \code
   int id = (int)::ftok("/tmp/my_lock_identifier", 0);

   QSystemReadWriteLock lock(id, false);
   \endcode
   
   An ftok(3) call on the same file was used to ensure the owner and the 
   non-owner use the same id and thus refer to the same system-global lock.

   \section1
   \section2 Algorithm

   The QSystemReadWriteLock class uses Linux kernel semaphores to synchronize
   access between readers and writers.  Two semaphores ReadCount and WriteCount
   are used to allow either multiple concurrent readers or a single exclusive
   writer.  When writers are waiting, any new readers must wait until all
   writers complete.  That is, writers can starve readers.

   The following semaphore conditions determine reader and writer operations.

   \table
   \header
       \o Operation
       \o Condition Steps
   \row
       \o Reader Progression
       \o WAIT(Increment ReadCount) AND WAIT(WriteCount == 0)
   \row
       \o Reader Complete
       \o WAIT(Decrement ReadCount)
   \row
       \o Writer Progression
       \o WAIT(Increment WriteCount)
   \row
       \o
       \o WAIT(ReadCount == 0)
   \row
       \o Writer Complete
       \o WAIT(Decrement WriteCount)
   \endtable

    \brief The QSystemMutex class provides mutual exclusion between processes.

    A mutex is a synchronization tool for protecting critical sections of the 
    code.  The purpose of a QSystemMutex is to protect an object, data structure
    or section of code so that only one thread, or process, can access it at a 
    time.

    QSystemMutex behaves much like the QMutex class, but it also works across 
    multiple processes (although it also works perfectly well, albeit slightly 
    less efficiently, in a single process).  In order to clean up the system 
    resources used to coordinate cross process synchronization, one 
    QSystemMutex instance is designated the lock "owner".  This instance creates
    the required resources, and removes them when it is destroyed.  The lock 
    owner should always be instantiated before any others.

    System locks are identified by a 32-bit integer, which allows other 
    processes to share the same lock.  While the selection of this identifier is
    left upto the caller, under Linux it is common to use the ftok(3) function 
    call which uses the identity of a specified file to generate such an 
    identifier.

    \code
    int id = (int)::ftok("/tmp/my_lock_identifier", 0);

    QSystemMutex lock(id, true);
    \endcode

    The file passed to ftok(3) is only used to generate a unique identifier for
    the mutex and is otherwise unrelated to the mutx.  It is possible, although 
    bad practice due to potential unintended clashes with other applications 
    that do the same, to simply make up a number for the mutex id.  

    Other applications can then easily create a non-owner reference to the 
    mutex:

    \code
    int id = (int)::ftok("/tmp/my_lock_identifier", 0);

    QSystemMutex lock(id, false);
    \endcode

    An ftok(3) call on the same file was used to ensure the owner and the 
    non-owner use the same id and thus refer to the same system-global mutex.

  \class QMallocPool
  \inpublicgroup QtBaseModule

  \brief The QMallocPool class allows management of allocations within a
  designated memory region.

  QMallocPool provides heap management capabilities into a fixed region of
  memory.  Primarily this is useful for managing allocations in a shared
  memory region, but could be used in other scenarios.

  The QMallocPool class provides equivalents for most standard memory management
  functions, such as \c {malloc}, \c {calloc}, \c {realloc} and \c {free}.
  However, unlike these standard functions which acquire their memory from the
  system kernel, QMallocPool operators on a region of memory provided to it
  during construction.

  QMallocPool is based on dlmalloc, a public domain malloc implementation
  written by Doug Lea.  dlmalloc is used as the default allocator in many
  projects, including several versions of Linux libc.

  QMallocPool is not thread safe.

/*!
  \enum QMallocPool::PoolType

  Controls the type of pool to be created.  In order to manage memory, a small
  amount of book keeping information is maintained.  While this information is
  not required for reading from the managed pool, it is required for
  allocations.  The PoolType controls where this bookkeeping data is stored.

  \value Owned
  The bookkeeping data is maintained in the QMallocPool instance.  Allocation to
  the pool is only possible via this instance.
  \value NewShared
  The bookkeeping data is maintained in the managed region itself.  This allows
  multiple QMallocPool instances, possibly in separate processes, to allocate
  from the pool.

  The NewShared PoolType also initializes this bookkeeping data to its default
  state.  Thus, while the bookkeeping data is shared, only one of the sharing
  instances should use a NewShared type.  All other instances should use the
  Shared pool type.

  The malloc pool bookkeeping data contains absolute pointers.  As such, if
  multiple processes intend to allocate into the malloc pool, is is essential 
  that they map the memory region to the same virtual address location.
  \value Shared
  The bookkeeping data is stored in the managed region, and has previously been
  initialized by another QMallocPool instance constructed using the NewShared
  pool type.

  The malloc pool bookkeeping data contains absolute pointers.  As such, if
  multiple processes intend to allocate into the malloc pool, is is essential 
  that they map the memory region to the same virtual address location.

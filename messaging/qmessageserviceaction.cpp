    \class QMessageServiceAction

    \preliminary
    \ingroup messaging

    \brief The QMessageServiceAction class provides the interface for requesting 
    messaging services.

    QMessageServiceAction provides the mechanisms for messaging clients to request services, 
    and to receive information in response.  All actions present the same 
    interface for communicating status, and progress information.

    All actions communicate changes in their operational state by emitting the activityChanged()
    signal.

    Actions report progress information by emitting the progressChanged() signal.
    
    If an action operation fails after being initiated then the lastError() function will return 
    a value indicating the failure mode encountered.
    
    A client may attempt to cancel an operation after it has been initiated. The cancelOperation()
    slot is provided for this purpose.

    A QMessageServiceAction instance supports only a single request at any time. Attempting to
    initiate an operation on a QMessageServiceAction while another operation is already in
    progress will result in the later initiating function returning false. A client may, however,
    use multiple QMessageServiceAction instances to create a queue of requests that will be 
    performed sequentially.

    Each QMessageServiceAction instance will report only the changes pertaining to the request
    that instance delivers.

    Except where noted QMessageServiceActions may initiate network activity. Other functions in
    the mobility messaging API will not initiate network activity, with the exception of MAPI
    based platforms which may initiate network activity during the evaluation of any function
    call.

/*!
    \enum QMessageServiceAction::State

    This enum type is used to describe the state of the requested action.

    \value Pending          The action has not yet begun execution.
    \value InProgress       The action is currently executing.
    \value Successful       The action has completed successfully.
    \value Failed           The action could not be completed successfully, and has finished execution.

/*!
    \fn QMessageServiceAction::queryMessages(const QMessageFilter &filter, const QMessageOrdering &ordering, uint limit, uint offset) const
    
    Emits via messagesFound() signals \l{QMessageId}s of messages in the messaging 
    store. If \a filter is not empty only identifiers for messages matching the parameters 
    set by \a filter will be emitted, otherwise identifiers for all messages will be emitted.
    If \a ordering is not empty, then the identifiers will be sorted by the parameters 
    set by \a ordering.
    If \a limit is not zero, then \a limit places an upper bound on the number of 
    ids in the list returned.
    \a offset specifies how many ids to skip at the beginning of the list returned.
    
    Calling this function may result in the messagesFound() and progressChanged() 
    signals  being emitted multiple times. An emission of the progressChanged()
    signal with a total of 0 indicates that the number of progress steps is
    unknown.
    
    Returns true if the action can be initiated; otherwise returns false.

    Note: This function should not initiate network activity, instead only message data
    already stored on the device will be used during evaluation of the function.

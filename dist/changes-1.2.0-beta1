QtSensors
------
 - Add QLightSensor (LUX) [MOBILITY-1268]
 - Add QGyroscope (rotational acceleration) [MOBILITY-1266]
 - Allow sensor backends to be dynamically registered and unregistered.
   Backend plug-ins and applications can be notified when the available
   sensors have changed [MOBILITY-864]
 - Generic backends no longer override system backends. This primarily
   affects Symbian, which now uses native Orientation and Rotation backends
   by default.
 - Tap sensors that can only detect the axis, not the direction, now have
   a value they can return [MOBILITY-1878]
 - setDataRate and setOutputRange can once again be called before the
   backend is connected [MOBILITY-2087]
 - Filters were not properly deregisering themselves [MOBILITY-2401]
 - Don't unconditionally print out plugin loading errors [QTMOBILITY-1034]
 - Find out what filters are attached to a sensor [QTMOBILITY-574]
 - Platform-specific notes are available for Symbian, N900 and MeeGo and
   explain issues particular to each platform [MOBILITY-2481]
 - Allow setting up the axes on the N900 to match the standard adopted by
   Symbian and MeeGo [QTMOBILITY-1044]
 - Qt-style static plugins are now supported
 - Reading timestamps are not guaranteed to be monotonic (problems have been
   identified on Symbian, MeeGo and N900)
 - Blocking the event loop on Symbian no longer results in delayed sensor
   readings. Readings that cannot be processed quickly enough are now
   dropped by the system [QTMOBILITY-759]
 - Improve N900 reading timestamps. Still not guaranteed to be monotonic
   due to a kernel bug [MOBILITY-2091]
 - Update the simulator to support QLightSensor [MOBILITY-2686]
 - As much as possible, ensure sensors supply the current value when they
   are started. Especially important for sensors that change infrequently
   (eg. Orientation) [QTMOBILITY-1385]
 - Don't crash when using QCompass on Symbian [QTMOBILITY-1482]
 - Allow slower polling of N900 sensors [QTMOBILITY-1505]
 - N900 proximity sensor cannot run faster than 10Hz [QTMOBILITY-1505]

    - QTMOBILITY-922 devicelocked notification

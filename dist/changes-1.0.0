 - Symbian specific fixes
    * Notifications which are related to internal folders (0x100001
      and 0x100002) are ignored.
    * Notifications about messages which are "created and then
      immediately removed" (before message can be read to QMessage) are
      removed from notifications queue and are not ever tried to
      deliver.
    * Improved message filtering functionality in case when whole
      message should be used for filtering but whole message can not
      be read yet from message store.
    * Notifications which can be delivered immediately will be
      delivered without putting notifications into queue.
    * The following filter now works:
      registerNotificationFilter(
          QMessageFilter::byStandardFolder(QMessage::InboxFolder) &
          QMessageFilter::byType(QMessage::Mms))

 -  Contacts
    * Bug fix: Display label of a contact now does not include organization if first name or last name are available
    * Bug fix: Several fixes to contact filtering
    * Bug fix: Backends were instantiated twice. This caused for example a problem with SamplePhonebook startup; the application sometimes refused to re-start after it had been closed.
    * Bug fix: Adding contacts to a group or removing contacts from a group caused contactsChanged signal to be emitted instead of relationshipsAdded/Removed in other contact manager instances.
    * Bug fix: Adding a group caused also a contactsChanged signal to be emitted in the contact manager instance that created the group
    * Bug fix: QContactThumbnail was not shown in the name list view of S60 Phonebook on some S60 platforms.
    * Bug fix: Signal emissions when self contact is changed
    * Bug fix: Groups did not have timestamp and guid details.
    * Bug fix: S60 3.1 does not support timestamps for contacts but it was still part of the detail definition schema.
    * SIM backend now supports also SDN (Service Dialling Numbers) and FDN (Fixed Dialling Numbers)
    * Also SIM backend now emits signals
    * SIM backend now implements also the asynchronous QContactManager API
    * SIM contact phone numbers now don't have any sub type (previously they were using "mobile" sub type)
    * SIM contacts now use custom label as the name field instead of first name
    * SamplePhonebook can now be used to access and save also SIM contacts
    * Bugfix: Saving SIM contacts now preserves the original contact detail instances instead of replacing them with new instances (with different ids).
    * A work-around for issues with several consecutive SIM contacts operations
    * A work-around for issue on S60 3.1 products that made the device reboot when trying to delete non-existing contacts
    * Bug fix: Batch saving of SIM contacts did not update contact details
    * The schema definition of SIM backend now does not include e-mail and nick name details in case they are not supported by the SIM card
    * Trying to save too long details to a SIM card now gives an appropriate error

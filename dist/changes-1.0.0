****************************************************************************

QtBearer
------

 - Fixed MOBILITY-748: Private Qt header usage has been removed
 - Fixed MOBILITY-600: Memory leak on Mac fixed
 - Multiple optimizations on Mac OS
 - Maemo 5 and Maemo 6 use exact same code base
 - ConnectInBackground support for Symbian added
 - Maemo 5 (Fremantle) specific fixes
    * Fixed QTMOBILITY-70: bearermonitor application has serious layout issues
      preventing any use of the app
    * Fixed MOBILITY-723: BearerEx test application isn't usable in N900
    * Fixed MOBILITY-600: QNetworkSession is not asynchronous on Maemo and
      leads to crashes
 - Static analysis errors fixed
    

QtContacts
------

 - A large number of API changes have been made.  These were largely
   cosmetic or minor structural changes - the overall structure of the
   API is similar to the beta, with more consistency between different
   parts (particularly related to returning bool and using a map of
   errors)
    * The QContactAction (& related classes and APIs) has been removed - the
      intent is to re-add them once their design and implementation has been
      stabilized.
    * Some functionality has been removed (relationship ordering, action
      preferences for details).
    * QContactAvatar has been split into QContactThumbnail and QContactAvatar.
    * QContactOnlineAccount has been split into QContactPresence and QCOA
 - A number of new functions have been added (QCM::compatibleContact, 
      QCM::synthesizeContactDisplayLabel)
 - The API uses QImage instead of QPixmap, to avoid non-gui thread
   issues with QPixmap usage.
 - The names of details, and the keys of fields in details are now
   restricted to Latin 1 (for performance and memory usage optimization).
 - Bugs fixed etc


QtVersit
------

 - A number of API changes have been made, to make it easier to use
   the QtVersit library for simple tasks (like reading directly from
   a QByteArray), and to make the API more consistent with QtContacts
 - The API uses QImage instead of QPixmap, to avoid non-gui thread
   issues with QPixmap usage.


QtLocation
------

 - API change
    * QGeoPositionInfo::dateTime()/setDateTime() changed into
      QGeoPositionInfo::timestamp()/setTimestamp() respectively.
    * Added serialization functions for QGeoSatelliteInfo
 - Maemo 5 (Fremantle) backend implemented


QtMessaging
------

 - Maemo 5 (Fremantle) backend implemented
    * SMS and Email message types supported.
    * modest process must be restarted before Fremantle backend is fully
      operational. This can be achieved by restarting the device.
 - API changes
    * QMessageAddress::recipient()/setRecipient renamed to 
      QMessageAddress::addressee()/setAddressee respectively.
    * QMessage::XMPP renamed to QMessage::InstantMessage.
 - Symbian specific fixes
    * Notifications which are related to internal folders (0x100001
      and 0x100002) are ignored.
    * Notifications about messages which are "created and then
      immediately removed" (before message can be read to QMessage) are
      removed from notifications queue and are not ever tried to
      deliver.
    * Improved message filtering functionality in case when whole
      message should be used for filtering but whole message can not
      be read yet from message store.
    * Notifications which can be delivered immediately will be
      delivered without putting notifications into queue.
    * The following filter now works:
      registerNotificationFilter(
          QMessageFilter::byStandardFolder(QMessage::InboxFolder) &
          QMessageFilter::byType(QMessage::Mms))
 - Regression in keepintouch example fixed, incorrect results were returned 
   when 'but not last' checkbox was unchecked.
 - Format of identifiers changed
   * For forwards compatibility.


QtMultimedia
------
 - Symbian backend improvements
    * AudioCapture
      - Bug fixes and codec support improvements
    * Mediaplayer
      - Audio routing implemented (destinations speaker, headphones, default)

      - Note: Camera eventually separated from QtMedia API (has its own plugin)
 - Symbian^3 backend for audio recording (uses OpenMaxAL)
 - Tweaked few examples to have more features
 - Maemo 5 (Fremantle) backend implemented
 - AudioCapture
 - API changes
    * Added CoverArtImage, PosterImage, and ThumbnailImage meta-data keys to
      address embedded images.
    * Changed QVideoWidget to use the Qt::AspectRatioMode enumeration instead
      of defining its own enumeration of the same name.
 - Behavioural changes
   * Changed to QVideoWidget to consistently not fill the background with black
     by default.


QtPublishSubscribe
------

 - Maemo 5 (Fremantle) GConf backend finalized
    * Support for monitoring changes in GConf

****************************************************************************

Qt Mobility for Symbian
------

 -  Contacts
    * Bug fix: Display label of a contact now does not include organization if first name or last name are available
    * Bug fix: Several fixes to contact filtering
    * Bug fix: Backends were instantiated twice. This caused for example a problem with SamplePhonebook startup; the application sometimes refused to re-start after it had been closed.
    * Bug fix: Adding contacts to a group or removing contacts from a group caused contactsChanged signal to be emitted instead of relationshipsAdded/Removed in other contact manager instances.
    * Bug fix: Adding a group caused also a contactsChanged signal to be emitted in the contact manager instance that created the group
    * Bug fix: QContactThumbnail was not shown in the name list view of S60 Phonebook on some S60 platforms.
    * Bug fix: Signal emissions when self contact is changed
    * Bug fix: Groups did not have timestamp and guid details.
    * Bug fix: S60 3.1 does not support timestamps for contacts but it was still part of the detail definition schema.
    * SIM backend now supports also SDN (Service Dialling Numbers) and FDN (Fixed Dialling Numbers)
    * Also SIM backend now emits signals
    * SIM backend now implements also the asynchronous QContactManager API
    * SIM contact phone numbers now don't have any sub type (previously they were using "mobile" sub type)
    * SIM contacts now use custom label as the name field instead of first name
    * SamplePhonebook can now be used to access and save also SIM contacts
    * Bugfix: Saving SIM contacts now preserves the original contact detail instances instead of replacing them with new instances (with different ids).
    * A work-around for issues with several consecutive SIM contacts operations
    * A work-around for issue on S60 3.1 products that made the device reboot when trying to delete non-existing contacts
    * Bug fix: Batch saving of SIM contacts did not update contact details
    * The schema definition of SIM backend now does not include e-mail and nick name details in case they are not supported by the SIM card
    * Trying to save too long details to a SIM card now gives an appropriate error

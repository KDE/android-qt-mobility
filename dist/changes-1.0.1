New features
------

 - MOBILITY-991: Translation file support added

Other changes/optimizations
------

 - QTMOBILITY-50, QTMOBILITY-264, MOBILITY-971 fixed: various configure -prefix bugs fixed
 - configure tests on Symbian are based on arm builds (rather than winscw)
 - MOBILITY-908 fixed: -plugindir parameter added to configure.[sh|bat]
 - plugin project files simplified
 - MOBILITY-717 fixed: plug-in loading across all API's using plug-ins unified
   and fixed. This includes addition of PREFIX/plugins to standard plugin
   path lookup.
 - QTMOBILITY-129 fixed: namespace related documentation improved

*                   Important Behavior Changes                             *
****************************************************************************

 - building of Mobility requires "make install" step as binaries
   such as plug-ins and examples are not automatically deployed to BUILDDIR/plugins,
   BUILDDIR/bin or BUILDDIR/bin/examples anymore. Rpath values have been
   adjusted accordingly.

    * Symbian: Fix for determing additional detail support on SIM backend
    * Symbian: Phone number match filtering gave contacts that had been deleted
    * Symbian: SIM backend phonenumber matching
    * Symbian: Last modified timestamp is now updated during contact update

 - Symbian: Removed unnecessary capabilities from test modules and examples
 - Symbian: Display label is now empty for contacts with no names instead of non-localized "Unnamed"
 - Symbian: Removed timeout from sychronous methods to make batch APIs more reliable with hundreds of SIM contacts. (Asynchronous API provides timeouts if needed.)
 - Performance improvements with Maemo 5 engine when fetching ids
 - Fix compilation errors on Maemo 5 when required libraries are not installed
 - Better thread support for the request class (for multi threaded engines)
 - Use locale aware string comparisons when fallback filtering or sortind code is used

QtVersit
------
 - Properties with both ENCODING and CHARSET are properly handled now
 - Better round tripping of property names
 - Removed empty contact fields generated during import.

QtLocation
------

 - Several bugs on the Symbian platform have been fixed.
    * Using INT_MAX for the update interval no longer causes crashes.
    * The default preferred positioning methods for a new position source 
      are now reported accurately.
    * The last known position now respects the 
      fromSatellitePositioningMethodsOnly parameter correctly across 
      changes to the preferred position method.
 - MOBILITY-858 fixed: Crash in lightmaps example fixed

QtMessaging
------

 - API changes
    * None.

    * Fix for SMS message sending failed in some cases.
    * Fix for simultaneous calls to QMessageService::send(...) causing crash.
    * messagesAdded signal is now emitted only when message is ready to be 
      read.
    * retrieve* and exportUpdates functions are now asynchronous (MTM).
      Before this fix these functions always hanged for the whole operation 
      time.
    * UI fix for keepintouch example for N95.
    * String form of identifiers (QMessage*Id) are prefixed with platform tag.
 - Maemo 5 (Fremantle) specific fixes
    Latest version of libtpsession and qtm-modest-plugin is required for 
      these fixes.
    * Fix for SMS sending not working with defaultAccount.
    * Fix for multiple recipients not supported for SMS messages.
    * Fix for sending successive SMS did not send later queued ones.
    * Fix for queryMessages service action is synchronous for SMS messages.

      now retrieveBody() & retrieve() can correctly be used to retrieve 
      large messages from the server.
    * Folder name localization support.
    * UI fix for keepintouch example for N900.
    * String form of identifiers (QMessage*Id) are prefixed with platform tag.
 - Windows specific fixes
    * Windows Mobile: Fix QMessageService::retrieve for attachments larger 
      than 4KB on Windows.

QtMedia/QtMultimediaKit
------

 - The QtMedia library has been merged with the QtMultimediaKit library from Qt.
   The new QtMultimediaKit library in QtMobility replaces both the QtMedia libary
   from QtMobility and the QtMultimedia library from Qt.

 - Meta-data related API changes
     * Meta-data on QMediaObject is now read-only.  The isWritable(), 
       setMetaData() and setExtendedMetaData() function have been removed.
     * The meta-data editing functions removed from QMediaObject have been
       added to QMediaRecorder. 
     * QMetaDataControl has been split into two controls, the read-only
       QMetaDataReaderControl and the writable QMetaDataWriterControl.
 - Media Service API changes.
     * The API for requesting a control from a QMediaService has been split
       into request and release steps, allowing services to allocate and
       release resources on demand.  This removes the QMediaService
       control() function and adds requestControl(), and releaseControl().

QtPublishSubscribe
------

 - foo
    * bar

QtSensors
------
 - Bug fixes
    * correct cubehouse example to avoid extreem camera angle being used.
 - Added support for Symbian 3.2 and newer devices using the Symbian Sensor
   Framework.
 - Fixed rotation definition to be -90 < X < 90 so that the complete range of
   motion can be represented.
 - Corrected the rotation definition for the Z axis (it starts from the Y axis,
   not the X axis).
 - Clarify that the tap sensor cannot report on single and double tap events at
   the same time.
 - Remove the need for new sensor types to include qsensor_p.h. Note that this
   breaks forwards binary compatibility (a sensor type built against 1.0.1 will
   cause a crash when run against 1.0.0).
 - Backends should no longer set a data rate and should treat the default (0)
   as "app does not care".
 - Backends should no longer set an output range and should treat the default
   (-1) as "app does not care".
 - Binary compatibility broke on Symbian emulator (WINSCW) and most likely on
   Windows too (but not on Linux). This was due to the addition of extra const
   modifiers to the ::type members on QSensor sub-classes. This change was made
   to address a crash on Symbian caused by applications getting uninitialized
   pointers.
